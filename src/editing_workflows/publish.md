## Publishing your game

You publish your game via **File -> Publish**. The Engine opens the publishing tab.

In there, you have a couple of options:

| Option            | Description                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Executable Name   | The name of the executable, e.g. `test.exe`                  |
| Window Title      | The text which is displayed in the window title.             |
| World Entity      | The Entry point of your game.                                |
| Resolution        | The default resolution to use when running the published project |
| Fullscreen        | If checked the game will launch in Fullscreen                |
| Directory Project | Decides if the game data is published as binary data or as human readable directory. |





**Directory vs. none Directory Project**

If you check this option, the game is exported as a human-readable project. Otherwise the game data will be compressed and stored in a binary `.the_machinery` format.
