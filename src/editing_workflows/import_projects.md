# Import Projects

The Machinery allows to share and remix the content of projects made within the Engine via the import project feature.

*Project Import* provides an easy way to import assets from one The Machinery project to another. To use it, select **File > Import File…** and pick a The Machinery project file to import. The project you select is opened in a new *Import Project* tab and from there, you can simply drag-and-drop or copy/paste assets into your main project’s *Asset Browser*.

*Importing assets from another project.*

When you drag-and-drop or copy-paste some assets, all their dependencies are automatically dragged along so that they are ready to use.

Here is a video showing this in action. We start with a blank project, then we drag in a level from the physics sample and a character from the animation sample, put them both in the same scene, and play:

To make it even easier to share your stuff, we’ve also added **File > Import from URL…** This lets you import any file that The Machinery understands: GLTF, FBX, JPEG, or a complete The Machinery project directly from an URL. You can even import zipped resource directories in the same way.

For example, in the image below, we imported a Curiosity selfie from NASA (using the URL [https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/curiosity_selfie.jpg](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/curiosity_selfie.jpg) ) and dropped it into the scene we just created:

Have you made something interesting in *The Machinery* that you want to share with the world? Save your project as an *Asset Database* and upload it to a web server somewhere. 

Other people can use the *Import from URL…* option to bring your assets into their own projects.
