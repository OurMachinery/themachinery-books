## Sound

The Machinery comes with a low-level sound system that can import WAV files into the project and
play them back. The sound system can position sounds in 3D space and mix together 2D and 3D sounds
for output on a stereo, 5.1, or 7.1 sound system.

You can play a sound by adding a *Sound Source Component* to an object in the level of by using one
of the sound playing nodes in the visual scripting language.



### Missing features

The sound system is rudimentary. Here are some features that are planned for the future:

* Sound streaming
* Sound compression
* WASAPI backend
* React to the user plugging in or unplugging headphones
* Hermite-interpolated resampling
* Reverb
* Directional sound sources
* Doppler effect
* Multiple listeners
* HRTF
* High-level sound system
  * Random sounds
  * Composite sounds
  * Streaming sounds
  * Compressing sounds
