## License

There are three different licenses that you can use for The Machinery:

- The **Indie Free** license is completely free for indie developers and includes all of The
  Machinery, except for the source code.

- The **Indie Pro** license is exactly the same, but also includes the full source code of the
  engine and all associated tools. For this version we charge $100  / user / year.

- The **Business** version is aimed towards professional users. It includes the same stuff as the
  Indie Pro version except your support tickets will be prioritized. It sells at $900 /
  user / year.

We define as an “indie”, any company who’s yearly revenue or funding is less than $100K/year. 

All of the licenses allow for full royalty-free use of The Machinery. You can build and sell commercial games, tools, applications, and plugins. For more details, see our [pricing page](http://www.ourmachinery.com/pricing.html).

When you download The Machinery, you will be on the Indie Free license. If you do not fall in the "indie" category, you can still use this license to evaluate The Machinery, but you need to buy a business license to put it into production.
