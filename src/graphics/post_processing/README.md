# Post Processing

The Machineryâ€™s default render pipeline provides a basic post processing stack for common effects. All of these are handled through components and are capable of using the volume component to localize their effect to a spatial domain. This section will provide some clarity on how to best use these effects.

Currently we support the following post-processing effects:
- [Anti-Aliasing]({{base_url}}/graphics/post_processing/aa.html)
- [Exposure]({{base_url}}/graphics/post_processing/exposure.html)
- [Bloom]({{base_url}}/graphics/post_processing/bloom.html)
- [Color grading]({{base_url}}/graphics/post_processing/color_grading.html)
