# Adjusting Anti-Aliasing

Anti-Aliasing (AA) refers to various techniques for smoothing aliased, or jagged edges when dealing with a finite number of samples, like a monitor. The Machinery supports Temporal Anti-Aliasing (TAA) as a post-processing effect. Multisample Anti-Aliasing (MSAA) support is planned on a per image level, but is currently not available to all render backends.
