The renderer has been designed to take full advantage of modern explicit graphic APIs like Vulkan. You can reason explicitly about advanced setups such as multiple GPUs and GPU execution queues. Similar to the rest of the engine, the built-in rendering pipeline is easy to tweak and extend.

##  Supported graphics backends

- Vulkan 1.2
