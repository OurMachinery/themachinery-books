# Sample Projects

You can download any sample project you like from our website:  [OurMachinery: Samples](https://ourmachinery.com/samples.html). Alternatively you find them under **Help > Download Sample Projects** in the main menu. After you have downloaded them you can open them via the *Download Tab* or directly from the hard drive.

A few sample projects are coming by default with the Engine, you find them in the root folder under `samples/`. If you are interested in how our tools work you can look their source code up in the `code/` folder.
