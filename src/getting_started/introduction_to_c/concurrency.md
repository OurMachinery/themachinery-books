# Concurrency in Machinery

In The Machinery we are making use of our [Fiber Job System](https://ourmachinery.com/post/fiber-based-job-system/) as well as of our Task System. We have a blog post that explains our fiber job system in its core ideas [Fiber based job system](https://ourmachinery.com/post/fiber-based-job-system/). Also for more details in how they are implemented see our source code or check the api docs: [Job System]({{doc}}/foundation/job_system.h.html) and [Task System]({{doc}}/foundation/task_system.h.html). This guide introduces you on how to use them and how you can syncronize your data.
