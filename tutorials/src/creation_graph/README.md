# Creation Graph

In The Machinery, we provide full control over how data enters the engine and what data-processing 
steps get executed, allowing technical artists to better optimize content and setup custom,
game-specific asset pipelines. 

This is handled through [*Creation Graphs*]({{the_machinery_book}}/creation_graphs/concept.html). A Creation Graph is essentially a generic framework for 
processing arbitrary data on the CPUs and GPUs, exposed through a graph front-end view. While *Creation Graphs* are mostly used in the context of rendering, they can be used for any type of data processing.

The following section will guide you from basic use cases to more advanced use cases.

We have a couple of blog posts which you may also find interesting:
