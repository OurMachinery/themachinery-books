## Introduction

This walkthrough series makes use of the following free assets: [KhronosGroup](https://github.com/KhronosGroup)/**[glTF-Sample-Models](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models)**. During this series we will modify the assets. If you are interested in how to import assets into the Engine you can watch this video [Import and rigging tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loaYaeSl-_g&t=20s) or you follow this Guide [Import assets](https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book/editing_workflows/import_assets.html#import-assets). Besides this this series has one main goal to familiarize you with the "Core Creation Graphs" we hip with the Engine in the core folder. Most of all creation graphs the engine uses are build on top of those.
