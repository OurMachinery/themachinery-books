# Welcome

Hi,

This book is here to give you guidance on how to work with the engine. We are constantly working on improving the onboarding as much as possible. If you have not read about the basic concepts of the engine you might want to start at there before you move on to this book [The Machinery Book]({{the_machinery_book}}index.html).

Besides this book we have several other resources which might be good to checkout:

- [Our API Documentation]({{docs}}apidoc.html)

- [Our Podcast](https://anchor.fm/ourmachinery)
- [Our Discord](https://discord.gg/SHHSZaH)
- [Our Github Discussion Board](https://github.com/OurMachinery/themachinery-public/discussions)

Also feel free to checkout our internal

- [Programming Guidebook](https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/doc/guidebook.md.html)

> The purpose of this [Programming Guidebook](https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/doc/guidebook.md.html) is to lay down principles and guidelines for how to write code and work together at Our Machinery.

Enjoy!
