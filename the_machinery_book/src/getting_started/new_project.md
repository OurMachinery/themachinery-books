# Getting Started with a New Project

This walkthrough shows how to create a new project. It will also show you what comes by default with the Engine.

This part will cover the following topics:

- Project Pipeline
  - What is the difference between a directory project and a database project?
  - What is a Scene in The Machinery?
  - What comes by default with a project?

# About Projects

Let us talk about the concept behind projects first. In The Machinery, we have two kinds of projects: A database project and a directory project. The difference between both is that a database project results in one file rather than multiple files. It has the file ending `.the_machinery_db`. This database will contain all your assets. In contrast, a directory project saves all your assets, etc., in a specified project folder. It is possible to save a database project as a directory project and vise versa. 

> **Note:** If resaving a Database project as a Directory project or vice versa, be aware that these are two different projects. Hence changes to one will not apply to the other.

**Can I directly add Assets to my project from the File Explorer of my OS?**

**No**, the editor will not import assets directly added to the project folder via your OS File Explorer. However you can modify The Machinery files (in a directory project) during runtime or before. If you do this the Engine will warn you.

> Changes to the project on disk where detected: [Import] [Ignore]

More information of this topic [here](https://github.com/OurMachinery/themachinery-public/issues/435).

You handle the main project management steps through the **File Menu.** Such as Create and Save. By default, The Machinery will save your project as a directory project.


# About Scenes

In The Machinery, we do not have a concept of scenes in the traditional sense. All we have are Entities. Therefore any Entity can function as a scene. All you need is to add child entities to a parent Entity. The Editor will remember the last opened Entity. 
When publishing a Game, the Engine will ask you to select your "world" entity. You can decide to choose any of your entities as "world" Entity.

# New Project

After the Machinery has been launched for the first time and the login was successful, the Engine will automatically show you a new empty project. If you do not have an account, you can create an account for free [here](https://ourmachinery.com/sign-up.html), or if you had any trouble, don't hesitate to get in touch with us [here](mailto:ping@ourmachinery.com). 

At any other point in time, you can create a new project via **Files → New Project.**

A new project is not empty. It comes with the so-called "**Core**," a collection of valuable assets. They allow you to start your project quickly. Besides the *Core*, the project will also contain a default World Entity, functioning as your current scene. By default, the world entity includes 2 child entities: *light and post_process*. Those child entities are instances of prototypes. 

> A prototype in The Machinery is an entity that has been saved as an Asset. Prototypes are indicated by yellow text in the Entity Tree View.

### The Core
Let us discuss the Core a bit. As mentioned before, the Core contains a couple of useful utilities. They are illustrating the core concepts of the Engine, and they are a great starting point. They can be found in the Asset browser under the core folder:

A content overview of the core folder and its subfolders may looks like this:

- A light entity

- A camera entity

- A post-processing stack entity (named post-process in the world entity)

- A default light environment entity

- A post-processing volume entity

- A default world entity (the blueprint of the world entity)

- A bunch of helpful geometry entities. They are in the geometry folder.

  - A sphere entity
  - A box entity
  - A plane entity
  - as well as their geometry material

- A bunch of default creation graphs is in the folder creation_graphs

  - import-image
  - DCC-mesh
  - editor-icon
  - drop-image
  - DCC-material
  - DCC-image

  

## How to add some life to your project

All gameplay can be written in C or a C in any binding language such as C++ or Zig. You can also create gameplay code via the Entity Graph. The Entity Graph would live inside of a Graph Component. You can add that to an Entity. 

You can find more information about gameplay coding in the ["Gameplay Coding" Section]({{base_url}}gameplay_coding/index.html)



## Project Structure Recommendation

It is recommended to separate your gameplay source code, plugin code from the actual project and store them in a separate folder.

```
my_project/game_project // the directory project
my_project/game_plugins // the main folder for all your gameplay code, plugins
```
