## Introduction

This walkthrough series makes use of the following free assets:

* [KhronosGroup](https://github.com/KhronosGroup)/**[glTF-Sample-Models](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models)**.

During this series we will modify the assets. If you are interested in how to import assets into the Engine you can watch the video [Import and rigging tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loaYaeSl-_g&t=20s) or you follow theGuide [Import assets](https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book/editing_workflows/import_assets.html#import-assets). Besides this, this series has one main goal: to familiarize you with the "Core Creation Graphs" that we ship with the Engine in the core folder. Most creation graphs that the engine uses are built on top of those.
