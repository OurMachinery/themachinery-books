> You should read the [Physics Introduction]({{base_url}}/editing_workflows/physics.html) before you continue here.

In this section we will discuss some of the Samples in more detail. 

You can download the Physics Sample projects from the Download Tab: **Help → Download Sample Projects**

After you have downloaded the Physics Sample Project, you can open it:

The `Scenes` folder contains all sample scenes (entities). Double click on a sample scene of your choice to load it.

Each of the Sample Scenes is composed of multiple Entity Prototypes. You can find them in the `Special Objects` or in the `Shapes` folder:

*Special Objects* are entities with Graph Components attached that have associated logic.

*Shapes* are reused Entities to demonstrate different kind of Physic Bodies.

>  **Note:** If you change the Prototypes, all the instances will change as well. Keep this in mind when playing around with the samples. If you mess things up, you can always re-download a fresh sample project.
