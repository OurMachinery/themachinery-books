<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="what-is-the-machinery"><a class="header" href="#what-is-the-machinery">What is The Machinery?</a></h1>
<p><em>The Machinery</em> is a framework for building different kinds of 3D software: editors, tools, pipeline components, games, visualizations, simulations, toys, experiments, etc. You can think of it as a <em>game engine</em>, but it’s intended use stretches beyond games, covering a wide range of applications. What makes <em>The Machinery</em> special is that it is <em>lightweight</em> and completely <em>plugin-based.</em> That means that you are not limited to a single editor and runtime. Rather, you can mix and match components as you need (or write your own) to create your own unique experience. <em>The Machinery</em> can also be stripped down and run embedded, as part of a larger application.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="license"><a class="header" href="#license">License</a></h2>
<p>There are three different licenses that you can use for The Machinery:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Indie Free</strong> license is completely free for indie developers and includes all of The
Machinery, except for the source code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Indie Pro</strong> license is exactly the same, but also includes the full source code of the
engine and all associated tools. For this version we charge $100  / user / year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Business</strong> version is aimed towards professional users. It includes the same stuff as the
Indie Pro version except your support tickets will be prioritized. It sells at $900 /
user / year.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We define as an “indie”, any company who’s yearly revenue or funding is less than $100K/year. </p>
<p>All of the licenses allow for full royalty-free use of The Machinery. You can build and sell commercial games, tools, applications, and plugins. For more details, see our <a href="http://www.ourmachinery.com/pricing.html">pricing page</a>.</p>
<p>When you download The Machinery, you will be on the Indie Free license. If you do not fall in the &quot;indie&quot; category, you can still use this license to evaluate The Machinery, but you need to buy a business license to put it into production.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought an early adopters license, will I continue to pay the discounted price when my subscription renews?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, as long as you don't cancel your subscription, you will continue to pay the discounted price for the next 5 years.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="frequently-asked-questions"><a class="header" href="#frequently-asked-questions">Frequently asked questions</a></h1>
<blockquote>
<p>What counts as a &quot;user&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An individual that is using <em>The Machinery</em> as part of their work or working on a team building a game in <em>The Machinery</em>, whether they are a programmer, artist, animator, level designer, etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>have multiple machines and platforms, do I need separate licenses?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, the license is per user. You can use your license on as many different machines and platforms as you like.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who can use the indie license?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a company, you can use the indie license for your employees if the total revenue and funding of your company is less than $100K/year. As an individual, you can use the indie license if your total revenue from <em>The Machinery</em> or related work is less than $100K/year.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can I use the indie license for hobby/side project unrelated to my &quot;day job&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, you can get an indie license for you as an individual (to use for hobby/side projects) even if you work for a a company that makes more than $100K/year. This license is tied to you as an individual and you may not use it as part of your &quot;day job&quot; work (if you want to do that, you need a Business license). Also, if your side project starts earning more than $100K/year, you will need a Business license for your side project.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you offer Academic licenses?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. You can use our <em>Indie Free</em> license for academic purposes. If you are interested in source code access for academic purposes, see our <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/academic.html">Academic License</a> page.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you offer discounts for emerging markets? (South America, Africa, etc.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We'd like to. If you are located in one of these markets and want to offer us more insight into your needs, please <a href="mailto:ping@ourmachinery.com">contact us</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you offer volume discounts?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We offer pricing for large companies through our Enterprise license. Please <a href="mailto:ping@ourmachinery.com">contact us</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure what pricing structure fits my studio/myself, but I don't consider myself an &quot;Enterprise&quot; can I contact you for a bespoke license?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes! We understand some studios and individuals might have different needs regarding what tools they need or even payment plans. Please <a href="mailto:ping@ourmachinery.com">contact us.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I get a Pro license just for myself, can I build custom versions of the engine and distribute them to the rest of my team?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No. If you are working on a game as a team, everybody on the team needs to be on the same license. So in this case, everybody would need to be on the Pro license. If you have a loosely organized team with contractors or part-time workers, you need at least one license per full-time equivalent. So if you have 10 people working 50 % on the team, you need 5 licenses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I make a game with The Machinery, do I have to keep paying for the license to sell the game?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No. As long as you are actively working on the game (making updates, patches, etc) you need an active license, but you don't need a license just to distribute or sell a game that you are no longer actively working on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can I evaluate the engine without buying a license?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, you can download the binary version of the engine and use it for evaluation purposes without obtaining a license. You may not use the engine in production while evaluating it. If you are interested in evaluating the source code, please <a href="mailto:ping@ourmachinery.com">contact us.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I bought an early adopters license, will I continue to pay the discounted price when my subscription renews?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, as long as you don't cancel your subscription, you will continue to pay the discounted price for the next 5 years.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How does source code access work?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you buy a license with source code included, you will be given direct access to our <a href="https://github.com/ourmachinery/themachinery">GitHub repository</a> which contains all the source code of <em>The Machinery</em>.</p>
<p>To link your GitHub account, enter your GitHub account information on your <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/profile.html">Profile</a> page. You should get an invite to the <a href="https://github.com/ourmachinery/themachinery">repository</a> in a couple of hours.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I signed up for source code but didn't get access.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Make sure your GitHub account is correctly entered on the <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/profile.html">Profile</a> page. It should be your account name, not your email.</p>
<p>GitHub invites frequently end up in the Spam folder. Check there or go to the <a href="https://github.com/ourmachinery/themachinery">repository</a> to see your invite.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can I sell tools developed using The Machinery APIs?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, you can commercialize any game, tool, application, content, etc created with <em>The Machinery</em> as long as you have a valid license.</p>
<blockquote>

<h2 id="a-crash-happened"><a class="header" href="#a-crash-happened">A Crash happened</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes it can come to crashes. There are a few steps to follow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is your System (Window or Linux) on the latest update?</li>
<li>Do you have the latest Graphics Driver installed?</li>
<li>Does your system support <code>vulkan 1.2</code>?</li>
<li>Does your system full fills our system requirements?</li>
<li>Did someone else have this issue before? Check on Discord or  <a href="https://github.com/OurMachinery/themachinery-public/issues">GitHub issues page</a></li>
</ol>
<p>In case you cannot debug the crash yourself you should create a issue on our Issue Tracker:  <a href="https://github.com/OurMachinery/themachinery-public/issues">GitHub issues page</a>. To obtain the logs or crash dumps follow the next steps:</p>
<h3 id="windows-10--windows-11-editor"><a class="header" href="#windows-10--windows-11-editor">Windows 10 &amp; Windows 11 Editor</a></h3>
<p>When it comes to crashes on Windows which you cannot debug yourself. You can enable a full crash dumb via the following file <code>utils/enable-full-dumps.reg</code>. The dumps can be found in the folder <code>AppData\Local\The Machinery</code> and then in the  <code>CrashDumps</code> folder. In case of an error report it can be very helpful to provide access to the crash dump. You can submit bugs on our public <a href="https://github.com/OurMachinery/themachinery-public/issues">GitHub issues page</a>. Please do not forget to mention your current Engine version.</p>
<p>In order to obtain log files you have to go to the same folder where you can find the CrashDumps (<code>AppData\Local\The Machinery</code>) but they till instead be in the <code>Logs</code> subfolder.</p>
<h3 id="linux-1"><a class="header" href="#linux-1">Linux</a></h3>
<p>When it comes to crashes on Linux which you cannot debug yourself. The dumps can be found in the folder <code>/home/YOU_USER/.the_machinery</code> and then in the  <code>CrashDumps</code> folder. In case of an error report it can be very helpful to provide access to the crash dump. You can submit bugs on our public <a href="https://github.com/OurMachinery/themachinery-public/issues">GitHub issues page</a>. Please do not forget to mention your current Engine version.</p>
<p>In order to obtain log files you have to go to the same folder where you can find the Crash Dumps (<code>/home/YOU_USER/.the_machinery</code>) but they till instead be in the <code>Logs</code> subfolder.</p>
<h3 id="graphics"><a class="header" href="#graphics">Graphics</a></h3>
<p>In case of a crash you will get an error message, this will give some information about the details of the crash. The first step in a Vulkan related crash is to update your graphics drivers. If this didn’t help then please report the issue to us with the following information.</p>
<ul>
<li>The error message you got when the crash happened, this should include file information and a Vulkan error code, it’s vital to share these.</li>
<li>The log file, see the previous section on how to obtain this.</li>
<li>A crash dump file, see the previous section on how to obtain this.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can submit bugs on our public <a href="https://github.com/OurMachinery/themachinery-public/issues">GitHub issues page</a>. Please do not forget to mention your current Engine version and provide a copy of your logs.</p>
<h2 id="tmbuild-cannot-find-build-tools"><a class="header" href="#tmbuild-cannot-find-build-tools">tmbuild cannot find build tools</a></h2>
<p>In case of a non typical installation of Visual Studios you have to provide to tmbuild the correct environment variables: <code>TM_VS2017_DIR</code> or <code>TM_VS2019_DIR</code>. They need to point to the root directory of your Visual Studio installation.</p>
<h2 id="tmbuild-cannot-find-environment-variables"><a class="header" href="#tmbuild-cannot-find-environment-variables">tmbuild cannot find environment variables</a></h2>
<p>Before we can build any project, we need to set up our environment. You need to set the following environment variable: (If this one has not been set the tool will not be able to build)</p>
<ul>
<li><code>TM_SDK_DIR</code> - This is the path to find the folder <code>headers</code> and the folder <code>lib</code></li>
</ul>
<p>If the following variable is not set, the tool will assume that you intend to use the current working directory:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>TM_LIB_DIR</code> - The folder which determines where to download and install all dependencies (besides the build environments)</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure you have added the needed environment variables. Follow this guide on <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book//helper_tools/tmbuild.html">tmbuild</a>.</p>
<h2 id="clang-format-pollutes-my-git-commits"><a class="header" href="#clang-format-pollutes-my-git-commits">clang-format pollutes my git commits</a></h2>
<p>Make sure that you are using the <code>clang-format</code> version the engine downloads for you and add to the <code>TM_LIB_DIR</code>. The engine uses the version 6.0. In case you are using visual studio or visual studio code make sure it points to the right executable!</p>

<p>You can make use of <code>tmbuild</code> (from the binary build) to download the engine (source code) and install all needed dependencies as well. This can be done via <code>tmbuild --install</code> in this case you may want to use <code>--github-token</code> as well and provide your token. As alternative you just clone the repo as you are used to from any other git repositry.</p>

<p>Let us talk about the concept behind projects first. In The Machinery, we have two kinds of projects: A database project and a directory project.  It is possible to save a database project as a directory project and vice versa. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If resaving a Database project as a Directory project or vice versa, be aware that these are two different projects. Hence changes to one will not apply to the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-directory-project"><a class="header" href="#the-directory-project">The Directory Project</a></h2>
<p>A directory project saves all your assets, etc., in a specified project folder. This file format is better suited for source control.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/7xqwlu6yi6y35nz/tm_guide_directory_project.png?dl=1" alt="view of a directory project in the Windows explorer" /></p>
<h2 id="the-asset-database-project"><a class="header" href="#the-asset-database-project">The Asset database Project</a></h2>
<p>The difference between both is that a database project results in one file rather than multiple files. It has the file ending <code>.the_machinery_db</code>. This database will contain all your assets.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/kjmrx89my0olh6z/tm_guide_db_project.png?dl=1" alt="database project in the file explorer" /></p>
<h2 id="project-management"><a class="header" href="#project-management">Project Management</a></h2>
<p><strong>Can I directly add Assets to my project from the File Explorer of my OS?</strong></p>
<p><strong>No</strong>, the editor will not import assets directly added to the project folder via your OS File Explorer. However you can modify The Machinery files (in a directory project) during runtime or before. If you do this the Engine will warn you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Changes to the project on disk where detected: [Import] [Ignore]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More information on this topic <a href="https://github.com/OurMachinery/themachinery-public/issues/435">here</a>.</p>
<p>You handle the main project management steps through the <strong>File Menu.</strong> Such as Create and Save. By default, (1) The Machinery will save your project as a directory project. However you can save your current project as an Asset Database (2).</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/qosmerpjea1agss/tm_guide_saving_project.png?dl=1" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="possible-folder-structure-for-a-project"><a class="header" href="#possible-folder-structure-for-a-project">Possible folder structure for a project</a></h2>
<p>The following project shows a possible folder structure of a game project. <strong>This is not a recommendation just a suggestion</strong>. At the end it depends on your needs and your workflows how your projects should be structured.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/sbdsy1k5wjay89c/tm_guide_possible_folder_structure.png?dl=1" alt="" /></p>
<ol>
<li><code>game_project</code> contains a The Machinery Directory Project</li>
<li><code>plugins</code> contains the dll of  your plugins (should not be checked in into source control)</li>
<li><code>raw_assets</code> may contain the raw assets your DCC tool needs to process. Your the Machinery project can point here and you maybe able to just reimport things from there if needed</li>
<li><code>src</code> contains the source code of your plugins. They can be in multiple sub folder depending on your liking and need.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example <code>src</code> folder</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/l1429g7p5xx8kj2/tm_guide_possible_subfolder.png?dl=1" alt="" /></p>
<p>In here we have one single <code>premake</code> file and a single <code>libs.json</code> as well as the <code>libs</code> folder. This allows you to run <code>tmbuild</code> just in this folder and all plugins or the ones you want to build can be built at once. Besides it will generate one solution for Visual Studio. In this example all plugins will copy their <code>.dll/so</code> files into the <code>../plugins</code> folder. </p>
<p>A possible <code>.gitignore</code></p>
<pre><code>plugins/*
src/libs/*
</code></pre>
<p>as well as the default Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code and C/C++ gitignore content.</p>

<p><a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It is also a decentralized source control tool. This means that there is no central repository that you have to use to either fetch the latest or push your changes too. All your changes are locally stored as well as the entire project history. In case you have set up a remote repository you can push your changes to the remote repository. This means you can work offline and and still make use of the benefits of version control. To support large files such as binary files you need to setup <a href="https://git-lfs.github.com/">Git Large File Storage (LFS)</a>. The default workflow is CLI (command line based) but there are many different alternatives for a GUI (See later).</p>
<p>In contrast <a href="https://www.perforce.com/">Perforce (Helix Core)</a> is a centralized version control tool that needs a central repository always available and you check your changes in directly to the central repository. This also means that you can only get a different version (revision) of the repository if you are online. Also working offline and making use of the benefits of source control are not given. Helix core (Perforce) supports binary store build in you do not need to do anything other than check them in. The main workflow is GUI based and all bundled in a few applications.</p>
<p>In contrast to both <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and <a href="https://www.perforce.com/">Perforce (Helix Core)</a>, <a href="https://www.plasticscm.com/">PlasticSCM</a> is designed to support both workflows decentralized (like git) and centralized (like perforce). Moreover Plastic SCM supports large files such as binaries build in. As with perforce plastic's worklfow is mainly GUI based.</p>

<p>You should checkin (push/commit) your entire directory project into your Git Repository. When it comes to your plugins we recommend to checkin your source code not the binaries (unless they are project plugins therefore they live in the project).. For this we recommend the following <code>.gitignore</code> files:</p>
<p>The default C/C++ <code>.gitignore</code> file you can find online <a href="https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/C.gitignore">C gitignore</a> or <a href="https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/C++.gitignore">C++ gitignore</a> with the following modifications:</p>
<pre><code>plugins/*
src/libs/*
bin/*

<p>You should checkin (push/commit) your entire directory project to Perforce. When it comes to your plugins we recommend to checkin your source code not the binaries (unless they are project plugins therefore they live in the project).  You should make use of the <code>P4IGNORE </code> functionality. This is similar to <code>.gitignore</code> files.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that you must be running a 2012.1 (or higher) Perforce Server in order to take advantage of the new P4IGNORE functionality. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to use this new functionality with P4V two configuration steps are needed:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Create a text file in the client root containing a list of the filetype(s) to be ignored. The name of the file is not important, but we suggest using something meaningful like &quot;p4ignore.txt&quot;. The User's Guide includes a section entitled &quot;<a href="https://www.perforce.com/perforce/doc.current/manuals/p4guide/index.html#P4Guide/less_common.files.ignore.html">Ignoring groups of files when adding</a>&quot; which describes the use of P4IGNORE files. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set the P4IGNORE environment variable to the name of the file you created in step 1 above. For example:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-bash">p4 set P4IGNORE=p4ignore.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Restart P4V for the changes to take effect.</p>
<h3 id="windows-example"><a class="header" href="#windows-example">Windows Example</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Set up a P4V icon on your Windows desktop</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right-click P4V icon, Properties</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change Start in: directory to your client workspace root directory (or it can be a directory of your choice)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open a command prompt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set the P4IGNORE variable</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>p4 set P4IGNORE=C:\Perforce\p4ignore.txt
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>C:\Perforce</code> is an existing directory</p>
<ol>
<li>Create the p4ignore.txt file</li>
</ol>
<p>In this example we will ignore the addition of any new .o files.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cd C:\Perforce

notepad p4ignore.txt
</code></pre>
<p>In notepad you add:</p>
<pre><code class="language-txt">*.o
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Close and save the file </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Restart P4V</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verify P4IGNORE is working</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Attempt to add a .o file in P4V.</p>

<h1 id="about-scenes"><a class="header" href="#about-scenes">About Scenes</a></h1>
<p>In The Machinery, we do not have a concept of scenes in the traditional sense. All we have are Entities. Therefore any Entity can function as a scene. All you need is to add child entities to a parent Entity. The Editor will remember the last opened Entity. 
When publishing a Game, the Engine will ask you to select your &quot;world&quot; entity. You can decide to choose any of your entities as &quot;world&quot; Entity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For more information on publishing, check <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book/editing_workflows/publish.html">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="new-project"><a class="header" href="#new-project">New Project</a></h1>
<p>After the Machinery has been launched for the first time and the login was successful, the Engine will automatically show you a new empty project. If you do not have an account, you can create an account for free <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/sign-up.html">here</a>, or if you had any trouble, don't hesitate to get in touch with us <a href="mailto:ping@ourmachinery.com">here</a>. </p>
<p>At any other point in time, you can create a new project via <strong>Files → New Project.</strong></p>
<p>A new project is not empty. It comes with the so-called &quot;<strong>Core</strong>,&quot; a collection of valuable assets. They allow you to start your project quickly. Besides the <em>Core</em>, the project will also contain a default World Entity, functioning as your current scene. By default, the world entity includes 2 child entities: <em>light and post_process</em>. Those child entities are instances of prototypes. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A prototype in The Machinery is an entity that has been saved as an Asset. Prototypes are indicated by yellow text in the Entity Tree View. </p>
<p>For more information about Prototypes, click <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book/editing_workflows/prototypes.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>All gameplay can be written in C or a C in any binding language such as C++ or Zig. You can also create gameplay code via the Entity Graph. The Entity Graph would live inside of a Graph Component. You can add that to an Entity. </p>
<p>You can find more information about gameplay coding in the <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book/gameplay_coding/index.html">&quot;Gameplay Coding&quot; Section</a></p>
<h2 id="project-structure-recommendation"><a class="header" href="#project-structure-recommendation">Project Structure Recommendation</a></h2>
<p>It is recommended to separate your gameplay source code, plugin code from the actual project and store them in a separate folder.</p>

<p>Let us create a new project and than add some gameplay to it. Before this, let us define a goal:
<em>This part aims to create a plane and a cube that we can move with W on this plane.</em></p>
<p>It requires multiple steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a plane to the Scene</li>
<li>Add a box to the Scene</li>
<li>Add a camera</li>
<li>Make the box and the plane physical so the box cannot fall through</li>
<li>Add an Entity graph for the movement</li>
</ul>
<p>The first one is to add a plane to our Scene. As we remember in <em>Core</em> in the folder <em>geometry</em>, we have a plane entity. All we need to do is drag it into the Scene and scale it a bit up.</p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_09462F237550F87F4C86951FAA779F713337E632E917FE6E6B8E3406BD58F125_1615459641040_add_plane.gif" alt="Open the core/geometry folder and add the plane.entity to the scene by dragging it into the scene" /></p>
<p>The next step is as straightforward as the first step. We repeat what we did before and drag and drop the box from the geometry folder into the scene tab. After this, we can see what happens in the simulation. To start the simulation and open the simulation tab, you need to click on the &quot;play&quot; button.</p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_09462F237550F87F4C86951FAA779F713337E632E917FE6E6B8E3406BD58F125_1615460126086_image.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The moment the simulation tab opens, the simulation starts. As you might have guessed, nothing happens. You can navigate in the tab by using the AWSD keys if no custom camera is selected. Also, we can pause, reset the current simulation or increase the simulation speed.</p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_09462F237550F87F4C86951FAA779F713337E632E917FE6E6B8E3406BD58F125_1615460267868_image.png" alt="Pause, reset and increase simulation speed" /></p>
<p>Let us go back to the scene tab and add some more exciting things. The next point of our task list is to add physics. To make our entities aware of physics, we need to add the Physics Shape and Physics Body Component to the corresponding entities. 
In this case, the plane should have the Physics shape component that we set as a plane shape, and the box should have the physics shape component and the physics body component. 
Adding a component to an entity can be done either through right-click on and then <strong>Add Component</strong> via the Entity tree or the property tab and the Add component button. It is also possible to select an entity in the Entity Tree and use Space.</p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_09462F237550F87F4C86951FAA779F713337E632E917FE6E6B8E3406BD58F125_1615461868389_image.png" alt="box entity" />
<img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_09462F237550F87F4C86951FAA779F713337E632E917FE6E6B8E3406BD58F125_1615461884406_image.png" alt="plane entity" /></p>
<p>To visualize the box shape or the plane shape, we can use the visualization menu in either the scene or simulation tab.</p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_09462F237550F87F4C86951FAA779F713337E632E917FE6E6B8E3406BD58F125_1615462081977_image.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>When the simulation starts, the box - if placed above the plane - will fall on the plane. Isn't this already more exciting?</p>
<h2 id="add-some-movement"><a class="header" href="#add-some-movement">Add some movement</a></h2>
<p>The next step is to make the box move. There are two approaches we could do a physicals-based movement or just a placement change. We are starting with the simpler option: Placement Change.</p>
<p>We need to add Graph Component to the box entity. (We could also add it to any other entity or the world entity, but we add it to the box for simplicity and organization's sake add it to the box).</p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_09462F237550F87F4C86951FAA779F713337E632E917FE6E6B8E3406BD58F125_1615462362939_image.png" alt="Add Menu opened via right click “Add Component”" /></p>
<p>When the Graph component has been added, all we need is to double-click the Component, and the Graph Editor opens.</p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_09462F237550F87F4C86951FAA779F713337E632E917FE6E6B8E3406BD58F125_1615462398554_image.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The Graph Editor View is empty. We can add new nodes via pressing Space or right-click a new node. It opens the node adding a menu. In there, we can search for nodes.</p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_09462F237550F87F4C86951FAA779F713337E632E917FE6E6B8E3406BD58F125_1615462451823_image.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The Entity Graph is an event-based Visual Scripting Language. It means events will trigger actions. </p>
<p>There are three main events we should use for a particular type of action:</p>
<ul>
<li>Init Event - This gets called when the Graph component gets initialized. The perfect place to set up variables etc.</li>
<li>Tick Event - For all actions that need to happen on Tick (Be aware that this might influence your game performance if you do expensive things always on tick)</li>
<li>Terminate Event - For all actions that need to happen when the Component gets removed. It mainly happens when the Entity gets destroyed.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also create custom events and listen to them. You can define those events in the graph itself or in C.</p>
<p>Our first iteration will use changing the placement of our box whenever we use the key <code>W</code>. The Machinery input system is based on polling rather than on events. 
We can check if key was pressed via the &quot;Key Poll&quot; node needs to be checked every frame. Therefore a tick event is a need. The &quot;Key Poll&quot; node requires the specify the key and returns a Boolean (true/false) if a key has been pressed, is down, released, or up.
It leads to the following setup:</p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_09462F237550F87F4C86951FAA779F713337E632E917FE6E6B8E3406BD58F125_1615463509298_image.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>In this setup on tick, it's being checked if the key &quot;w&quot; is down. If that is the case, the graph will execute the logic. </p>
<p>What is the actual logic? The actual logic is </p>
<ol>
<li>to get the Entity</li>
<li>get its transform</li>
<li>get the components of the transform (split the vector in x,y,z)</li>
<li>manipulate the x value</li>
<li>set the new transform to the Entity</li>
</ol>
<p>In the Entity Graph, any entity of the current Scene can be referenced by name. It 
happens via the &quot;Scene Entity&quot; node. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If no name is provided, it will return the graph components Entity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_09462F237550F87F4C86951FAA779F713337E632E917FE6E6B8E3406BD58F125_1615463752914_image.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The return type is an Entity. When we drag the wire into the void, the Add Node menu will suggest only nodes which take the Entity as input:</p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_09462F237550F87F4C86951FAA779F713337E632E917FE6E6B8E3406BD58F125_1615463814348_image.png" alt="With expanded Entity Category" /></p>
<p>We should connect the entity wire with a Get Transform node to get the world transform. Then the transform position should be split into its components. After this, component X should be modified by adding 10 * delta time.</p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_09462F237550F87F4C86951FAA779F713337E632E917FE6E6B8E3406BD58F125_1615463996352_image.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>To get the delta time, all that is needed is to add the delta time node and multiple its float value with 10.</p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_09462F237550F87F4C86951FAA779F713337E632E917FE6E6B8E3406BD58F125_1615464050098_image.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>When all this is complete, we should set the position of the Entity to the new value. First, a new position vector needs to be constructed by adding the old values to it and then the new modified value.</p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_09462F237550F87F4C86951FAA779F713337E632E917FE6E6B8E3406BD58F125_1615464121876_image.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The next step is to tell the Entity to use this position instead of the old one. This happens through the Set Transform node.</p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_09462F237550F87F4C86951FAA779F713337E632E917FE6E6B8E3406BD58F125_1615464271230_image.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Note that we leave all the other things as they were. It means they remain as before the change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we simulate the Scene now, the box moves, but it won't fall into the void if we move it to beyond the plane. It was to be expected because the physics system has not been updated, and therefore the velocity has not changed.</p>

<p>To make the box move with the physics system, we can use the node &quot;PhysX Push&quot;:</p>

<li>The <strong>Main Menu</strong>: It allows you to navigate through the Engine, such as opening new tabs or import assets</li>
<li>The <strong>Entity Tree</strong> shows a tree view of the entity you are editing. It shows the entity's components and child entities. You start editing an entity by double-clicking it in the asset browser. </li>
<li>The <strong>Scene</strong> shows an editable graphic view of the edited entity. You can manipulate components and child entities by selecting them. Use the <em>Move</em>, <em>Rotate</em>, and <em>Scale</em> gizmos for your desired action.</li>
<li>The <strong>Simulate current scene</strong> button will open the <strong>Simulate</strong> tab that lets you &quot;run&quot; or &quot;simulate&quot; a scene.</li>
<li>The <strong>Properties</strong> tab shows the properties of the currently selected object in the Scene. You can modify the properties by editing them in the properties window.</li>
<li>The <strong>Console</strong> tab shows diagnostic messages from the application.</li>
<li>The <strong>Asset Browser</strong> shows all the assets in the project and enables you to manage them.</li>
<li>The <strong>Preview</strong> shows a preview of the currently selected asset in the asset browser.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Editor is a collection of editing <em>Tabs</em>, each with its specific purpose. You can drag tabs around to rearrange them. When you drag them out of the window, a new window opens. Use the <em>View</em> menu to open new tabs.</p>
<h2 id="questions-you-might-have"><a class="header" href="#questions-you-might-have">Questions you might have</a></h2>
<h3 id="where-are-my-gameobjects"><a class="header" href="#where-are-my-gameobjects">Where are my GameObjects?</a></h3>
<p>The Machinery has no concept of GameObjects in the sense as Unity does. The Engine is based around Entities and Components. In the game world, not the editor, everything lives within the Entity Component System (ECS). To be exact, it lives within the Entity Context, an isolated world of entities. Your GameObjects are split into data and Behaviour. </p>
<p>You would usually couple your logic together with data in your C# MonoBehaviour scripts. In The Machinery, you separated them into Components and Systems / Engines. They represent your data and Systems or Engines that represent your Behaviour. They operate on multiple entities at the same time. Each Entity Context (the isolated world of Entities) has several systems/engines registered to them.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-the-difference-between-a-system-and-an-engine"><a class="header" href="#what-is-the-difference-between-a-system-and-an-engine">What is the difference between a System and an Engine?</a></h4>
<p>An Engine update is running on a subset of components that possess some set of components. Some entity component systems are referred to as <em>systems</em> instead, but we choose <em>Engine</em> because it is less ambiguous.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a system is an update function that runs on the entire entity context. Therefore you can not filter for specific components.</p>
<h3 id="where-are-my-prefabs"><a class="header" href="#where-are-my-prefabs">Where are my Prefabs?</a></h3>
<p>What Unity calls Prefabs is more or less what we call <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book/editing_workflows/prototypes.html">Prototypes</a>. Our prototype system allows entity assets to be used inside other entities. Therefore, you can create an entity asset that represents a room and then creates a house entity that has a bunch of these room entities placed into it. For more information on Prototypes, check out its <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book/editing_workflows/prototypes.html">Prototypes</a>.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-i-script"><a class="header" href="#how-do-i-script">How do I script?</a></h3>
<p>The Machinery supports two ways of gameplay coding by default:</p>
<ol>
<li>using our Visual Scripting Language (<a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book/editing_workflows/visual-scripting.html">Entity Graph</a>)</li>
<li>using our C API's to create your gameplay code. This way, you can create your Systems/Engines to handle your gameplay.</li>
</ol>
<p>You do not like C? Do not worry! You can use C++, Zig, Rust, or any other language that binds to C.</p>
<h3 id="where-are-my-materials-shaders-textures-particle-effects"><a class="header" href="#where-are-my-materials-shaders-textures-particle-effects">Where are my Materials, Shaders, Textures, Particle Effects?</a></h3>
<p>All of these can be represented via the <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book/creation_graphs/concept.html">Creation Graphs</a>.</p>
<h3 id="project-data"><a class="header" href="#project-data">Project data?</a></h3>
<p>The Machinery supports two types of Project formats:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Directory Project (Default)</li>
</ol>
<p>A Source control and human-friendly project format in which your project is stored on Disk in separate files (text and binary for binary data)</p>
<ol>
<li>The Database Project</li>
</ol>
<p>A single binary file project. It will contain all your assets and data. This format is mainly used at the end to pack your data for the shipping/publishing process.</p>
<h3 id="where-do-i-put-my-assets"><a class="header" href="#where-do-i-put-my-assets">Where do I put my assets?</a></h3>
<p>At this point in time, you can only drag &amp; drop your assets via the Asset Browser as well as via the Import Menu. See more in the section about importing assets. <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book/editing_workflows/import_assets.html">How to import assets</a></p>
<h3 id="import-difference-between-unity-and-the-machinery-dcc_asset"><a class="header" href="#import-difference-between-unity-and-the-machinery-dcc_asset">Import difference between Unity and The Machinery: <code>.dcc_asset</code></a></h3>
<p>When importing assets created in e.g. Maya they will be imported as <code>dcc_asset</code>. A <code>dcc_asset</code> can hold all types of data that was used to build the asset in the DCC-tool, such as objects, images, materials, geometry and animation data.</p>
<p>During the import step, The Machinery only runs a bare minimum of data processing, just enough so that we can display a visual representation of the asset in the <em>Preview</em> tab. Imports run in the background so you can continue to work uninterrupted. When the import finishes the asset will show up in the <em>Asset Browser</em>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong> that import of large assets can take a significant amount of time. You can monitor the progress of the import operation in the status bar.</p>

<p>Visual Scripting is a perfect solution for in-game logic flow (simple) and sequencing of actions. It is a great system for artists, designers, and visually oriented programmers. It is important to keep in mind that the Visual Scripting language comes with an overhead that you would not pay in C (or any other Language you may use for your gameplay code).</p>

<p>The Machinery has no concept of Nodes in the sense as Godot does. The Engine is based around Entities and Components.</p>
<p>Everything within the Game World lives within the Entity Component System (ECS). To be exact, it lives within the Entity Context, an isolated world of entities. Your Nodes are split into data and behaviour.</p>
<p>You would usually couple your logic together with data when working in Godot. This coupling happens because Godot uses the Object-oriented approach while The Machinery uses the Data-Oriented approach. Hence you would inherit classes to compose different kinds of behaviour. </p>
<p>In The Machinery, you separated them into Components and Systems / Engines. They represent your data and Systems or Engines that represent your Behaviour. They operate on multiple entities at the same time. Each Entity Context (the isolated world of Entities) has several systems/engines registered to them. In the following image we broke down an example player in Godot into separate parts (components) and its methods into separate Engines.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/mw0hb5itj5zck7g/tm_guide_object_to_ecs.png?dl=1" alt="" /></p>
<p>Important to understand is that the Player Class on the left does not equal the Entity on the left! Since the Entity on the left is just a weak reference to the components, it does not own the data, unlike the Player Class. The Components together form the player and the Systems/Engines on the far right just consume a few of those components, they do not need to understand them all!</p>
<p>This setup allows you to compose entities that are reusing the same engines/systems! For example all your other entities that can move can use the Movement Engine and Jump Engine to get the jump function.  All you need to do is compose entities with the:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transform Component</li>
<li>Physics Mover Component</li>
<li>Jump Component</li>
<li>Movement Component</li>
</ul>
<p>The Movement Engine and Jump Engine will pick them up and apply the same logic to them!</p>

<p>An Engine update is running on a subset of components that possess some set of components. Some entity component systems are referred to as <em>systems</em> instead, but we choose <em>Engine</em> because it is less ambiguous.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a system is an update function that runs on the entire entity context. Therefore you can not filter for specific components.

<p>The Machinery supports two ways of gameplay coding by default:</p>
<ol>
<li>using our Visual Scripting Language (<a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book/editing_workflows/visual-scripting.html">Entity Graph</a>)</li>
<li>using our C APIs to create your gameplay code. This way, you can create your Systems/Engines to handle your gameplay.</li>

<p>In the Machinery, all we care about is your plugins. Therefore if you want your plugins (tm_ prefixed shared libs.) to be globally accessible, please store them in the /plugins folder of the Engine. An alternative approach is to create plugin_asset in the Engine then your plugin becomes part of your project.</p>
<p>Please check out the introduction to the <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book/extending_the_machinery/the_plugin_system.html">Plugin System</a> as well as the <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book/extending_the_machinery/plugin-assets.html">Guide about Plugin Assets</a>.</p>
<h3 id="using-visual-scripting-2"><a class="header" href="#using-visual-scripting-2">Using Visual Scripting</a></h3>
<p>Visual Scripting is a perfect solution for in-game logic flow (simple) and sequencing of actions. It is a great system for artists, designers, and visually oriented programmers. It is important to keep in mind that the Visual Scripting language comes with an overhead that you would not pay in C (or any other Language you may use for your gameplay code).</p>

<p>These are things that differ from std C practices.</p>
<h2 id="memory-management"><a class="header" href="#memory-management">Memory Management</a></h2>
<p>While programming plugins for the Machinery, you will encounter the need to allocate things on the heap or generally speaking. In standard C code, you might tend to use <code>malloc, free or realloc</code>. Since we try to be as allocator aware as possible, we pass allocators actively down to systems. This means that wherever you need a long-life allocator (such as <code>malloc</code>), we give a <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/allocator.h.html#structtm_allocator_i"><code>tm_allocator_i</code></a> object down. This allows you to allocate memory like you would with <code>malloc</code>. Like in std C you need to free the memory allocated via a <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/allocator.h.html#structtm_allocator_i"><code>tm_allocator_i</code></a> at the end of its use. Otherwise you may leak. Using our built-in allocators gives you the benefits of automatic leak detection at the end of your program. Since all allocations are registered and analyzed at the end of the application, you will be notified if there is a leak. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> more about leak detection and memory usage check the chapter about the <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book//qa_pipeline/memory.html">Memory Usage Tab</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="child-allocators"><a class="header" href="#child-allocators">Child Allocators</a></h3>
<p>In case you check our projects you will find that we are making extensive use of child allocators. This allows us to log the use of their memory in our <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book//qa_pipeline/memory.html">Memory Usage Tab</a>.</p>
<p>In case you check our <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book/extending_the_machinery/write-a-tab.html"><code>Write a custom Tab</code> example</a> you will find in its create function this code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">static tm_tab_i* tab__create(tm_tab_create_context_t* context, tm_ui_o *ui)
{
    tm_allocator_i allocator = tm_allocator_api-&gt;create_child(context-&gt;allocator, &quot;my tab&quot;);
    uint64_t* id = context-&gt;id;

    static tm_the_machinery_tab_vt* vt = 0;
    if (!vt)
        vt = tm_global_api_registry-&gt;get(TM_CUSTOM_TAB_VT_NAME);

    tm_tab_o* tab = tm_alloc(&amp;allocator, sizeof(tm_tab_o));
    *tab = (tm_tab_o){
        .tm_tab_i = {
            .vt = (tm_tab_vt*)vt,
            .inst = (tm_tab_o*)tab,
            .root_id = *id,
        },
        .allocator = allocator,
    };

    return &amp;tab-&gt;tm_tab_i;
}

static void tab__destroy(tm_tab_o* tab)
{
    tm_allocator_i a = tab-&gt;allocator;
    tm_free(&amp;a, tab, sizeof(*tab));
    tm_allocator_api-&gt;destroy_child(&amp;a);
}
</code></pre>
<p>The tm_tab_create_context_t context gives you access to the system allocator. This one again allows you to create a child allocator. We can now use the new allocator in our tab. This is why we store it within our <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/plugins/ui/docking.h.html#tm_tab_o"><code>tm_tab_o</code></a> object.
In the end, we need to destroy our tab and, therefore free the tab object and destroy the child allocator. <code>tm_allocator_api-&gt;destroy_child(&amp;a);</code>
If we now shut down the engine and we forgot to free any of the allocations done between create and destroy, we will get a nice log:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">D:\git\themachinery\plugins\my_tab\my_tab.c(100): error leaked 1 allocations 4112 bytes
D:\git\themachinery\foundation\memory_tracker.c(120): error: Allocation scope `application` has allocations
</code></pre>
<h3 id="rule-of-the-thumb"><a class="header" href="#rule-of-the-thumb">Rule of the thumb</a></h3>
<p>Like in std C any allocation done with <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/allocator.h.html#tm_alloc()"><code>tm_alloc</code></a> or <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/allocator.h.html#tm_alloc_at()"><code>tm_alloc_at</code></a> and <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/allocator.h.html#tm_realloc()"><code>tm_realloc</code></a> should be followed by a <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/allocator.h.html#tm_free()"><code>tm_free</code></a>!</p>
<h3 id="temporary-allocator"><a class="header" href="#temporary-allocator">Temporary Allocator</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes we need to allocate data within a function. Sadly we do have access to the default allocator or do not want to give access to an allocator. Do not worry. The temp allocator comes to the rescue and the frame allocator. These are two concepts for quick allocations that you can forget about because the memory will free them at the end of the function or the frame!</p>
<p><strong>How to use the temp allocator?</strong></p>
<p>The temp allocator is part of the foundation and lives in its header file: <code>foundation/temp_allocator.h</code> Some APIs require temp allocators as the input. They will use them to allocate data that is needed for processing. At first, we need to create an object by using the following macro: <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/temp_allocator.h.html#tm_init_temp_allocator()"><code>TM_INIT_TEMP_ALLOCATOR(ta)</code></a></p>
<p>A temp allocator is created and can be used now! Importantly do not forget to call <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/temp_allocator.h.html#tm_shutdown_temp_allocator()"><code>TM_SHUTDOWN_TEMP_ALLOCATOR(ta)</code></a> at the end; otherwise, you have a memory leak! Do not worry. You won't be able to compile without calling this function!
Back to our example. Let's ask the Truth for all objects of a specific type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">TM_INIT_TEMP_ALLOCATOR(ta);
tm_tt_id_t* all_objects = tm_the_truth_api-&gt;all_objects_of_type(tt, type, ta);
// do some magic
TM_SHUTDOWN_TEMP_ALLOCATOR(ta);
</code></pre>
<p>The truth API will now use the temp allocator to create the list. We do not need to call tm_free anywhere, this is all done at the end by <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/temp_allocator.h.html#tm_shutdown_temp_allocator()"><code>TM_SHUTDOWN_TEMP_ALLOCATOR</code></a>!</p>
<p>Sometimes APIs require a normal <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/allocator.h.html#structtm_allocator_i"><code>tm_allocator_i</code></a>, but you are not interested in creating an actual allocator or have access to a memory allocator! No worries, we have your back! The Temp Allocator gives you the following macro: <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/temp_allocator.h.html#tm_init_temp_allocator_with_adapter()"><code>TM_INIT_TEMP_ALLOCATOR_WITH_ADAPTER(ta, a)</code></a>; It generates a normal <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/allocator.h.html#structtm_allocator_i"><code>tm_allocator_i</code></a> uses the temp allocator as its backing allocator. Hence all allocations done with the allocator will be actually done via the <code>ta</code> allocator! Again at the end, all your memory is freed by <code>TM_SHUTDOWN_TEMP_ALLOCATOR(ta);</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You also have <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/temp_allocator.h.html#tm_temp_alloc()"><code>tm_temp_alloc()</code></a> they expect a <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/temp_allocator.h.html#structtm_temp_allocator_i"><code>tm_temp_allocator_i</code></a> instead of the <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/allocator.h.html#structtm_allocator_i"><code>tm_allocator_i</code></a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What is the Frame Allocator?</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://ourmachinery.com//apidoc/foundation/temp_allocator.h.html#structtm_temp_allocator_api">tm_temp_allocator_api</a> has a frame allocator. A frame allocator allocates memory for one frame and then at the end of the frame the memory is wiped out. This means any allocation done with it will stay in memory until the end of the frame! The way of using it is: <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/temp_allocator.h.html#structtm_temp_allocator_api.frame_alloc()"><code>tm_temp_allocator_api.frame_alloc()</code></a> or <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/temp_allocator.h.html#tm_frame_alloc()"><code>tm_frame_alloc()</code></a></p>
<h3 id="great-use-case-formatted-strings"><a class="header" href="#great-use-case-formatted-strings">Great use case: Formatted Strings</a></h3>
<p>Both the frame as well as the temp allocator are great for using when you need to have a string with formatting! Infact the <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/temp_allocator.h.html#structtm_temp_allocator_api"><code>tm_temp_allocator_api</code></a> provided an extra function for this: <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/temp_allocator.h.html#structtm_temp_allocator_api.printf()"><code>tm_temp_allocator_api.printf()</code></a> /<a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/temp_allocator.h.html#structtm_temp_allocator_api.frame_printf()"><code>tm_temp_allocator_api.frame_printf()</code></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> About formatting checkout the <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/sprintf.h.html#structtm_sprintf_api"><code>tm_sprintf_api</code></a>  or <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book//qa_pipeline/logging.html">the logging chapter</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="arrays-vectors-lists-where-is-my-stdvector-or-list"><a class="header" href="#arrays-vectors-lists-where-is-my-stdvector-or-list">Arrays, Vectors, Lists where is my <code>std::vector&lt;&gt;</code> or <code>List&lt;&gt;</code></a></h2>
<p>In the foundation we have a great header file or better inline header file the <code>foundation/carray.inl</code> which contains our solution for dynamic growing arrays, lists etc.  When used you are responsible for its memory and have to free the used memory at the end! Do not worry, the API makes it quite easy. </p>
<p>Let us create an Array of <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/api_types.h.html#structtm_tt_id_t"><code>tm_tt_id_t</code></a>. All we need to do is declare our variable as a pointer of <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/api_types.h.html#structtm_tt_id_t"><code>tm_tt_id_t</code></a>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">tm_tt_id_t* our_ids = 0;
</code></pre>
<p>After this we can for example push / add some data to our array:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">tm_carray_push(our_ids,my_id,my_allocator);
</code></pre>
<p>Now the my_id will be stored in the our_ids and allocated with my_allocator! In the end when I do not need my array anymore, I can call: <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/carray.inl.html#tm_carray_free()"><code>tm_carray_free(our_ids,my_allocator)</code></a>, and my memory is freed!</p>
<p>This doesn't look very pleasant when I am working with a lot of data that only needs to be a temporary list or something. For this case, you can use our temp allocator! Every <code>tm_carray_</code> macro has a <code>tm_carray_temp_</code> equivalent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is also recommended to make use of <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/carray.inl.html#tm_carray_resize()"><code>tm_carray_resize</code></a> or <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/carray.inl.html#tm_carray_temp_resize()"><code>tm_carray_temp_resize</code></a> if you know how many elements your array might have. This will reduce the actual allocations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Going back to our previous example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">TM_INIT_TEMP_ALLOCATOR(ta);
tm_tt_id_t* all_objects = tm_the_truth_api-&gt;all_objects_of_type(tt, type, ta);
// do some magic
TM_SHUTDOWN_TEMP_ALLOCATOR(ta);
</code></pre>
<p><code>tm_the_truth_api-&gt;all_objects_of_type</code> actually returns a <code>carray</code> and you can operate on it with the normal C array methods: e.g. <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/carray.inl.html#tm_carray_size()"><code>tm_carray_size()</code></a> or <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/carray.inl.html#tm_carray_end()"><code>tm_carray_end()</code></a>. Since it is allocated with the temp allocator you can forget about the allocation at the end as long as you call <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/temp_allocator.h.html#tm_shutdown_temp_allocator()"><code>TM_SHUTDOWN_TEMP_ALLOCATOR</code></a>.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-access-an-element"><a class="header" href="#how-to-access-an-element">How to access an element?</a></h3>
<p>You can access a carray element normally like you would access it in a plain c array:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">TM_INIT_TEMP_ALLOCATOR(ta);
tm_tt_id_t* all_objects = tm_the_truth_api-&gt;all_objects_of_type(tt, type, ta);
if(all_objects[8].u64 == other_objects[8].u64){
    // what happens now?
}
TM_SHUTDOWN_TEMP_ALLOCATOR(ta);
</code></pre>
<h3 id="iterate-over-them"><a class="header" href="#iterate-over-them">Iterate over them</a></h3>
<p>You can iterate over the carray like you would iterate over a normal array:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">TM_INIT_TEMP_ALLOCATOR(ta);
tm_tt_id_t* all_objects = tm_the_truth_api-&gt;all_objects_of_type(tt, type, ta);
for(uint64_t i = 0;i &lt; tm_carray_size(all_objects);++i){
    TM_LOG(&quot;%llu&quot;,all_objects[i].u64);// we could also use TM_LOG(&quot;%p{tm_tt_id_t}&quot;,&amp;all_objects[i]);
}
TM_SHUTDOWN_TEMP_ALLOCATOR(ta);
</code></pre>
<p>An alternative approach is a more for each like approach:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">TM_INIT_TEMP_ALLOCATOR(ta);
tm_tt_id_t* all_objects = tm_the_truth_api-&gt;all_objects_of_type(tt, type, ta);
for(tm_tt_id* id = all_objects;id != tm_carray_end(all_objects);++id){
    TM_LOG(&quot;%llu&quot;,id-&gt;u64);// we could also use TM_LOG(&quot;%p{tm_tt_id_t}&quot;,id);

<p>After opening the Engine, you should see the Editor's interface with menus along the top of the interface, and the basic tabs opened. The following image will show you the default engine layout.
Here's a brief description of what you can see:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/67sdkq7sxnkbkou/tm_editor.png?dl=1" alt="" /></p>
<ol>
<li>The <strong>Main Menu</strong>: It allows you to navigate through the Engine, such as opening new tabs or import assets</li>
<li>The <strong>Entity Tree</strong> shows a tree view of the entity you are editing. It shows the entity's components and child entities. You start editing an entity by double-clicking it in the asset browser. </li>
<li>The <strong>Scene</strong> shows an editable graphic view of the edited entity. You can manipulate components and child entities by selecting them. Use the <em>Move</em>, <em>Rotate</em>, and <em>Scale</em> gizmos for your desired action.</li>
<li>The <strong>Simulate current scene</strong> button will open the <strong>Simulate</strong> tab that lets you &quot;run&quot; or &quot;simulate&quot; a scene.</li>
<li>The <strong>Properties</strong> tab shows the properties of the currently selected object in the Scene. You can modify the properties by editing them in the properties window.</li>
<li>The <strong>Console</strong> tab shows diagnostic messages from the application.</li>
<li>The <strong>Asset Browser</strong> shows all the assets in the project and enables you to manage them.</li>
<li>The <strong>Preview</strong> shows a preview of the currently selected asset in the asset browser.</li>

<p>The Editor is a collection of editing <em>Tabs</em>, each with its specific purpose. You can drag tabs around to rearrange them. When you drag them out of the window, a new window opens. Use the <em>View</em> menu to open new tabs.</p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_688CFE67758A45D845E788E6DA05448A2BCF730C2B07FEF2D06AB18D2C46F736_1625426655184_image.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Note that you can have multiple tabs of the same type. For example, you can open various <em>Asset Browser</em> tabs to drag assets between them easily. Tabs docked in the same window work together. Therefore if you dock a <em>Preview</em> tab in the same window as an <em>Asset Browser</em>, it will show a preview of the selected asset in that browser. You can create multiple windows to view numerous assets simultaneously:</p>

<p><strong>Editor layouts</strong></p>
<p>You can rearrange the Editor layouts by dragging tabs around in the Editor. The best structure for the Editor depends on what you are doing and your personal preferences. You can save layouts via the Window Menu. It is also possible to restore your layout to the default one or load a custom-defined one in this menu.</p>

<p>Windows in The Machinery have a root <strong>tab-well</strong> covering the whole window. A tab-wells are rectangular areas containing one or more tabs. You can split them either horizontally or vertically to form two-child tab-wells. Also, you can switch around tabs within a tab-well via the keyboard using Ctrl + 1-9 or via Ctrl Page Up/Down.</p>

<h3 id="pinning-options"><a class="header" href="#pinning-options">Pinning options</a></h3>
<p>In the context menu, you have more options for pinning. These allow you to manage and arrange the window layout in a way that suits your workflow. The following table will show all the possible options:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Option</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Pin via icon ⚲</td><td>Will pin the tab to the current shown content</td></tr>
<tr><td>Pin to View 🗖</td><td>This Pins the tab's content to another tab view that is currently open in the current window. You can pin a tab to multiple other tabs at the same time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Pin to Window 🗗</td><td>It pins the current tab to the selected window. For example, if you pin the Properties tab to Window 2. and choose an asset from the Asset Browser, the properties tab in Window 1. will display the selected asset.</td></tr>

<p>Besides, it is possible to extend the Engine with custom tabs. You can do this via the <strong>File → New Plugin → Editor Tabs.</strong> How to write your custom tab is out of the scope of this article but is covered <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book/extending_the_machinery/write-a-plugin.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>The <strong>Entity Tree</strong> shows the hierarchy of the entity you choose to edit. This view allows you to organize and add new entities as well as new components to the entities.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>  Just be aware that the Entity Tree does not reflect the current runtime state. </p>

<p>Besides, it is essential to remember is that <em>The Machinery</em> does not have specific <em>Scene</em> assets. A scene in <em>The Machinery</em> is just an entity with a lot of child entities.</p>

<p>In this tab, you can edit any entity from the current project. To start editing, you can either use <strong>Right Click → Open</strong> or <strong>Double Click</strong> the entity to open them. This action will update the Scene Tab and the entity tree view tab. If you close the Scene Tab, the Entity Tree Tab will display an empty tree.</p>
<h2 id="managing-entities"><a class="header" href="#managing-entities">Managing Entities</a></h2>
<p>A Scene is composed of child Entities and Parent Entities. When you create a new project, it starts with a &quot;world&quot; entity. This entity can be edited and lives as <code>world.entity</code> in your Asset Browser. You can create other Entities that function as your Scene. Any entity in the Asset Browser can serve as your Scene. Later, when publishing your game, you can choose the world entity you like. </p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_688CFE67758A45D845E788E6DA05448A2BCF730C2B07FEF2D06AB18D2C46F736_1625428013195_image.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Click a parent entity's drop-down arrow (on the left-hand side of its name) to show or hide its children. This action is also possible via the Keyboard: Arrow keys down and up let you navigate through the tree, while Arrow keys left and right allow you to show or hide the entity children. </p>

<p>The Entity Tree view, prototype instances are shown in yellow to distinguish them from locally owned child entities (which are shown in white).</p>
<p><strong>Prototypes:</strong> Prototypes are just entities that live in the Asset Browser as assets (.entity and the current entity in the Entity Tree View is based upon those entity assets. You can overwrite them in the Entity Tree View and make them unique, but any change to the asset will propagate to the entities based on the original prototype. <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book/editing_workflows/prototypes.html">More here</a></p>
<p>If you expand an instance, you will notice that most of its components and child entities are grayed out. They cannot be selected because they are inherited from the prototype, and the prototype controls their values.</p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_688CFE67758A45D845E788E6DA05448A2BCF730C2B07FEF2D06AB18D2C46F736_1625428053926_image.png" alt="The light entity is an instance of a prototype and the Render Component is inherited" /></p>

<p>You can add new children to an Entity through right-click and <em>&quot;Add Child Entity&quot;</em> or dragging an Entity Asset from the Asset Browser into the Entity Tree View.</p>
<h3 id="searching-and-changing-the-visibility-of-entities"><a class="header" href="#searching-and-changing-the-visibility-of-entities">Searching and changing the visibility of Entities</a></h3>
<p>You can search for entities via the filter icon, and you can hide all the components with the little <em>gear</em> icon next to it. You can also change the visibility of each entity via the little <em>eye</em> icon next to its name. If you change the visibility, you will hide the entity in the Scene View.</p>

<p>The <strong>Properties</strong> tab shows the properties of the currently selected object. You can modify the properties by editing them in the properties window. </p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_688CFE67758A45D845E788E6DA05448A2BCF730C2B07FEF2D06AB18D2C46F736_1625428761738_image.png" alt="" /></p>
<h3 id="use-mathematical-expression"><a class="header" href="#use-mathematical-expression">Use mathematical expression</a></h3>
<p>We’ve also have support for mathematical expression to our property editor. So you can now type both numerical values and expressions.</p>
<p>You can use <code>x</code> in the expression to mean whatever value the property had before, so if you type <code>x + 1</code> you will increase the current value by 1.</p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_AF44CABDD4BF19FA7D54C2D4574B155CAAE2ED895AFB490AC3671972A5F81DC2_1617121646846_expressions.gif" alt="Using expressions in the property editor." /></p>
<h3 id="multiple-tabs-with-different-properties"><a class="header" href="#multiple-tabs-with-different-properties">Multiple tabs with different properties</a></h3>
<p>You can have multiple tabs of different properties open if you wish. In this case, it comes very handily that you can pin Properties Tabs to a specific Object. 
Otherwise, the property tab will reflect the next selected object, and you would have multiple times the same thing open. 
You can pin content by clicking the <em>Pin</em> icon on Properties Tab. It will bind the current object to this instance. </p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_688CFE67758A45D845E788E6DA05448A2BCF730C2B07FEF2D06AB18D2C46F736_1625428863969_image.png" alt="Pin the properties tab for the prop floor barrel (module dungeon kit example)" /></p>
<p>Moreover, if you dock a <em>Preview</em> tab in the same window as an <em>Asset Browser</em>, it will show a preview of the selected asset in that browser.</p>
<p><strong>About Prototypes</strong></p>
<p>The Machinery has a prototype system that allows entity assets to be used within each other. Therefore you can create an Entity-Asset that represents a room and then create a house Entity with a bunch of these room entities placed within. 
We call the room asset a <em>prototype</em>, and we call each placed room entity an <em>instance</em> of this prototype. </p>
<p>Any Entity-Asset can be a prototype, with instances of it placed in another entity asset. Note that prototypes are not special assets. More about this <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book/editing_workflows/prototypes.html">here.</a></p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_688CFE67758A45D845E788E6DA05448A2BCF730C2B07FEF2D06AB18D2C46F736_1625428959141_image.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The overridden entities and components are drawn in blue. We change the x and z components of the position to move the box. Note how the changed values are shown in white, while the values inherited from the prototype are shown in grey. </p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="asset-browser"><a class="header" href="#asset-browser">Asset Browser</a></h1>
<p>The <strong>Asset Browser</strong> shows all your project's assets and enables you to manage them. It has multiple views at your exposal, which can make managing assets easier. The asset browser also allows you to search for assets in the current folder.</p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_688CFE67758A45D845E788E6DA05448A2BCF730C2B07FEF2D06AB18D2C46F736_1625429028821_image.png" alt="The asset browser’s grid view" /></p>
<p>As the image shows, the asset browser contains two components: The Directory Tree View of your project and the actual Asset View Panel.</p>

<p><strong>The Directory Tree View</strong> reflects all directories and subdirectories of your project. You can use it to navigate quickly through your project. The navigation works either via mouse or via keyboard. You have the same management functionality as in the Asset View Panel:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a new folder or assets to a folder</li>
<li>Rename, Delete, Copy, Cut, Paste, Duplicate folder</li>
<li>Drag Drop folder and reorganize the folder structure</li>
<li>Show in explorer if the current project is a directory project</li>
<li>Copy the path if the current project is a directory</li>
<li>Change Views: Change to Grid, Details or List view</li>
<li>Change the Filter &amp; Sorting</li>
</ul>
<p>All of those actions can be either done via the Main Menu or via the context menu.</p>
<p><strong>The Asset View Panel</strong> reflects all directories and sub directories as well as their assets in your project. This is the main place to organize your assets and folders. You have the same management functionality as in the Directory Tree View.</p>
<p>The Asset View Panel comes in three different views: <strong>Grid (default),</strong> <strong>Detail, and List-View.</strong>  You can change the views via the context menu or the <em>Change View</em> button next to the search field. Besides, there are also shortcuts to change the views: <strong>Shift + C</strong> will switch to the Grid View, <strong>Shift + L</strong> will change to the List view, and <strong>Shift + D</strong> will change to the details view. </p>

<p><strong>The Grid View</strong> will display your assets in a grid, which will shrink or grow depending on the tab size. In <strong>Details View</strong> allows you to see the details of your assets: What type are they easily? How big are they, and where on the disc are they located (if it's a directory project). The <strong>List-View</strong> will display your project's content in a list form.</p>
<p><strong>About filtering, sorting, and changing the view</strong>
There you have the option to filter via file extension or Asset-Labels. You can filter all assets by file extension type / Asset-Labels via the little filter icon or the context menu. You can also mix and match, as you require.</p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_688CFE67758A45D845E788E6DA05448A2BCF730C2B07FEF2D06AB18D2C46F736_1625429197285_image.png" alt="" />

<p>You can sort them via the context menu or the sort arrow up/down buttons (▲▼). Besides, there are also shortcuts to change the views: <strong>Shift + N</strong> will sort by Name <strong>Shift + S</strong> sort by Size, and <strong>Shift + T</strong> sort by type. The sorting will be applied in all view modes.</p>
<h2 id="search"><a class="header" href="#search">Search</a></h2>
<p>You can search in your project, and the default search is local. If you want to search globally, you want to click on the button with the Globe. This search will search for you in the entire project. Be aware your filters will influence your search!</p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_688CFE67758A45D845E788E6DA05448A2BCF730C2B07FEF2D06AB18D2C46F736_1625430508007_image.png" alt="Switch from local to global view" /></p>
<p>When searching globally, you can right-click on any search result and open the location of the selected asset.</p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_688CFE67758A45D845E788E6DA05448A2BCF730C2B07FEF2D06AB18D2C46F736_1625430660296_image.png" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="asset-management"><a class="header" href="#asset-management">Asset management</a></h2>
<p><em>Editing specific assets</em>
Double clicks on an asset may open the asset in their corresponding tab or window. Not all assets have a specific action associated with them. </p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Asset</th><th>Action on double click</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Animation State Machine (.asm)</td><td>Opens a new window with the Animation state machine layout.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Creation (.creation)</td><td>Opens a graph tab if no graph tab is open. If a graph tab is open it will load this graph. Whenever we have a <strong>.creation</strong> file the graph is called Creation Graph and is used for working on graphics related workflows such as materials.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Entity (.entity)</td><td>Opens a s<strong>cene tab</strong> if no scene tab is open. If a scene tab is open it will change the view to this entity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Entity Graph (.entity_graph)</td><td>Opens a graph tab if no graph tab is open. If a graph tab is open it will load this graph. Whenever we have a <strong>.entity_graph</strong> file the graph is called Entity Graph and is used to make Entity Graph functionality reusable and shareable between multiple graphs.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>A single click will always focus an associated Properties Tab on the selected asset.</p>
<p><em>Dragging assets into the Scene</em></p>
<p>You can drag assets around in the asset browser. It allows for quick reorganization of assets. It is also possible to drag assets from the asset browser directly into the Scene. Assets can be dragged from the Asset Browser Tab to other tabs if they support the asset type.
You can also drag assets from the Windows-Explorer into your project. This action supports the same formats as the regular importer via <strong>File → Import Assets.</strong> </p>
<p><em>Asset Labelling</em></p>
<p>To organize your project, you can use Asset Labels. An asset can be associated with one or more different asset labels. You can use them to filter your asset in the asset browser or plugins via the <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/plugins/editor_views/asset_label.h.html#structtm_asset_label_api">asset label api</a>.</p>
<p>There are two types of Asset labels: </p>
<ul>
<li>System Asset Labels: They are added by plugins and cannot be assigned by the user to an asset.
<ul>
<li>User Asset Labels: You add them, and they are part of the project with the file extension: .asset_label and can be found in the asset_label directory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The user can manage them like any other asset and delete user-defined Asset Labels via the asset browser. There you can also rename them, and this will automatically propagate to all users of those asset labels.</p>
<p><em>Add an Asset Label to as Asset</em> </p>
<p>You can add asset Labels via the property view to any asset:</p>
<ul>
<li>You select an Asset.</li>
<li>You expand the Label View in the Property View Tab.</li>
<li>You can type in any asset label name you want. The system will suggest already existing labels or allow you to create the new one.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_688CFE67758A45D845E788E6DA05448A2BCF730C2B07FEF2D06AB18D2C46F736_1625429529838_image.png" alt="1. Asset Label View in the Asset Property View Tab 2. The home of all your asset labels." /></p>

<p>In <em>The Machinery</em>, we make a distinction between <em>simulating</em> and <em>editing</em>. When you are <em>editing</em>, you see a static view of the scene. (Editing the scene with everything moving around would be very tricky.) all the runtime behaviors like physics, animation, destruction, entity spawning, etc., are disabled.
If you are building a game, the simulation mode will correspond to running the game. In contrast, when you are <em>simulating</em> or <em>running</em>, all the dynamic behaviors are enabled. It allows you to see the runtime behavior of your entities. To <em>simulate</em> a scene, open a scene in the <em>Simulate</em> tab.</p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_688CFE67758A45D845E788E6DA05448A2BCF730C2B07FEF2D06AB18D2C46F736_1625573554323_image.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Control over your simulation</strong>
While your simulation is running, you can Stop, reset or speed up the simulation.</p>

<h2 id="change-theme"><a class="header" href="#change-theme">Change Theme</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes we do not like the default theme or, based on reasons such as color blindness, and we cannot use the default theme. In the Machinery, you can change the default theme via <strong>Window -&gt; Theme</strong>. You will find a list of themes the user can select and use.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/yt180qozhyrw2zc/tm_guide_theme_picker.png?dl=1" alt="" /></p>
<p>The Engine comes by default with some base themes you can build your themes on top of:</p>

<tr><td>High Contrast Dark</td></tr>
<tr><td>High Contrast Light</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<h2 id="custom-theme"><a class="header" href="#custom-theme">Custom Theme</a></h2>
<p>If you like to customize the default themes or create a new theme, click on the &quot;<strong>New Theme&quot;</strong> menu in the same menu as the theme selection. After clicking this, the current Theme will be used as your base, and the Theme Editor Tab opens.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/imcy0y9wgxh252k/tm_guide_theme_create.png?dl=1" alt="" /></p>
<p>If you do not like the base, you can choose a different theme as a base.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="basic-editing-workflow"><a class="header" href="#basic-editing-workflow">Basic editing workflow</a></h1>
<p>The basic scene editing workflow in <em>The Machinery</em> looks something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Import some asset files into the Asset Browser using <strong>File &gt; Import…</strong> If you don't have any
models to work with you can find free ones at <a href="https://sketchfab.com">Sketchfab</a> for example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Organize the files by right-clicking the Asset Browser and choosing <strong>New &gt; New Folder</strong> and by
dragging and dropping.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any imported model, for example <code>fbx</code> or <code>gltf</code>, will appear as a <code>dcc_asset</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rig an entity from the <code>dcc_asset</code> by selecting it and clicking <em>Import Assets</em> in the property
panel. This also imports the materials and images inside the <code>dcc_asset</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Double click the imported entity to open it for editing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add components for physics, animation, scripting, etc to the entity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open a scene entity that you want to place your imported entity inside. A new project has a scene
entity called <code>world.entity</code> that you can use. Or you can create your own scene entity by right
clicking in the Asset Browser and choosing <strong>New &gt; New Entity</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drag your asset entities into the scene entity to position them in the scene.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the Move, Rotate, and Scale tools in the Scene tab to arrange the sub-entities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Holding down <em>shift</em> while using the move tools creates object clones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select entities or components in the Entity Tree and Scene tabs to modify their properties using the
Properties Tab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drag and drop in the Entity Tree Tab to re-link entities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each tool (Move, Rotate and Scale) has tool-specific settings, such as snapping and pivot point, in
the upper-left corner of the scene tab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use <strong>Scene &gt; Frame Selection</strong> and <strong>Scene &gt; Frame Scene</strong> to focus the
camera on a specific selected entity, or the entire scene. Or just use the <em>F key</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you are done, use <strong>File &gt; Save Project…</strong> to save the scene for future
work.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Known issues:</strong> When you drag a tab out of the current window to create a new one, you don’t
get any visual feedback until the new window is created.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="entities"><a class="header" href="#entities">Entities</a></h2>
<p><em>The Machinery</em> uses an entity-component based approach as a flexible way of
representing “objects” living in a “world”.</p>
<p>An <em>entity</em> is an independently existing object. An entity can have a number of
<em>components</em> associated with it. These components provide the entity with
specific functionality and features. The components currently available in <em>The</em>
<em>Machinery</em> are:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Component</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><strong>Animation Simple Player</strong></td><td>Plays individual animations on the entity.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Animation State Machine</strong></td><td>Assigns an Animation State Machine to the entity which can be used to play and blend between animations.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Camera</strong></td><td>Adds a camera to the entity. The <strong>Scene &gt; Camera</strong> menu option lets you view the scene through this camera.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Cubemap Capture</strong></td><td>Used to capture cubemaps to be used for rendering reflections.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Dcc Asset</strong></td><td>Renders an asset from a DCC tool. For more advanced rendering you would use the <em>Render</em> component.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Entity Rigger</strong></td><td>Used to &quot;rig&quot; an imported DCC Asset as an entity. See below.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Graph</strong></td><td>Implements a visual scripting language that can be used to script entity behaviors without writing code.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Light</strong></td><td>Adds a light source to the entity.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Physics Body</strong></td><td>Represents a dynamic physics body. Entities that have this component will be affected by gravity.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Physics Joint</strong></td><td>Represents a physics joint, such as a hinge or a ball bearing.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Physics Mover</strong></td><td>Represents a physics character controller. Used to move a character around the physics world.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Physics Shape</strong></td><td>Represents a physics collision shape. If the entity has a physics body, this will be a dynamic shape, otherwise a static shape.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Render</strong></td><td>Renders models output by a Creation Graph.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Scene Tree</strong></td><td>Represents a hierarchy of nodes/bones inside an entity. Entities with skeletons, such as characters have scene trees.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Sculpt</strong></td><td>Component used to free-form sculpt with blocks.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Sound Source</strong></td><td>Component that will play a looping sound on the entity.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Spin</strong></td><td>Sample component that spins the entity.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Tag</strong></td><td>Assigns one or more &quot;tags&quot; to an entity, such as &quot;bullet&quot;, &quot;player&quot;, &quot;enemy&quot;, etc. When implementing gameplay, we can query for all entities with a certain tag.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Tessellated Plane</strong></td><td>Sample component that draws a tessellated plane.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Transform</strong></td><td>Represents the entity’s location in the world (position, scale, rotation). Any entity that exists at a specific location in the world should have a Transform Component. Note that you can have entities without a Transform Component. Such entities can for example be used to represent abstract logical concepts.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Velocity</strong></td><td>Gives the entity a velocity that moves it through the world.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>In addition to components, an entity can also have <em>Child Entities</em>. These are
associated entities that are spawned together with the entity. Using child
entities, you can create complex entities with deep hierarchies. For example, a
house could be represented as an entity with doors and windows as child
entities. The door could in turn have a handle as a child entity.</p>
<p>In <em>The Machinery</em> entity system, an entity can't have multiple components of the same type. So you
can’t for example create an entity with two Transform Components. This is to avoid confusion
because if you allowed multiple Transform Components it would be tricky to know which represented
the “actual” transform of the entity.</p>
<p>In cases where you want multiple components (for example, you may want an entity
with multiple lights) you have to solve it by creating child entities and have
each child entity hold one of the lights.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that <em>The Machinery</em> does not have specific <em>Scene</em> assets. A scene in The
Machinery is just an entity with a lot of child entities.</p>

<p>Assets that are created by e.g. Maya will be of type after they are imported.  Where DCC stands for Digital Content Creation.  Materials wont be imported untill the <code>dcc_asset</code> has been dragged into the scene or used otherweise.</p>
<p>A <code>dcc_asset</code> can hold all types of data that was used to build the asset in the DCC-tool, such as objects, images, materials, geometry and animation data.</p>
<p>During the import step, The Machinery only runs a bare minimum of data processing, just enough so that we can display a visual representation of the asset in the <em>Preview</em> tab. Imports run in the background so you can continue to work uninterrupted. When the import finishes the asset will show up in the <em>Asset Browser</em>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong> that import of large assets can take a significant amount of time. You can monitor the progress of the import operation in the status bar.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-import-assets-into-the-project"><a class="header" href="#how-to-import-assets-into-the-project">How to import assets into the project</a></h2>
<p>The Machinery has three different ways of importing assets. The Import local files, Import remote files, Drag and Drop.</p>
<h3 id="import-via-the-file-menu"><a class="header" href="#import-via-the-file-menu">Import via the file menu</a></h3>
<p>The first method of important an asset is via the <strong>File</strong> menu. There, we have an entry called <em>Import File,</em> which opens a file dialog. There you can import any of the supported file formats. <em>Import File</em> allows for importing any supported asset archive of the type zip or 7zip. This archive will be unpacked and recursively checked for supported assets.
<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/kb50fpjuqwz7o6o/tm_guide_import_assets.png?dl=1" alt="" /></p>
<h3 id="import-from-url"><a class="header" href="#import-from-url">Import from URL</a></h3>
<p>It is possible to import assets from a remote location. In the <strong>File</strong> menu, the entry <em>Import from URL</em> allows for importing any supported asset archive of the type zip or 7zip. This archive will be unpacked and recursively checked for supported assets.</p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_8A68AE93396574AC0D937BFA8CFC626D302DBC4E0617A82A7B5162043ADD88EF_1615467083098_image.png" alt="" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The url import does not support implicitly provided archives or files such as https://myassetrepo.tld/assets/0fb778f1ef46ae4fab0c26a70df71b04 only clear file paths are supported.  For example: https://myassetrepo.tld/assets/tower.zip</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="drag-and-drop"><a class="header" href="#drag-and-drop">Drag and drop</a></h3>
<p>The next method is to drag and drop either a zip/7zip archive into the asset browser or an asset of the supported type.</p>
<h2 id="adding-the-asset-to-our-scene"><a class="header" href="#adding-the-asset-to-our-scene">Adding the asset to our scene</a></h2>
<p>In The Machinery a scene is composed of entities. The engine does not have a concept of scenes like other engines do. A dcc_asset that is dragged into the scene automatically extracts its materials and textures etc. into the surrounding folder and adds an entity with the correct mash etc. to the Entity view.</p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_8A68AE93396574AC0D937BFA8CFC626D302DBC4E0617A82A7B5162043ADD88EF_1615468046484_drag_dcc_asset.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>Another way of extracting the important information of a DCC asset is it to click on the DCC asset in the asset browser and click the button &quot;Extract Assets&quot; in the properties panel. 
This will exactly work like the previous method, but the main difference is that it creates a new entity asset that is not added to the scene. </p>
<p>Entity assets define a prototype in The Machinery. They are distinguished in the Entity Tree with yellow instead of white text. This concept allows having multiple versions of the same entity in the scene but they all change if the Prototype changes.</p>
<h2 id="about-import-setting"><a class="header" href="#about-import-setting">About Import Setting</a></h2>
<p>You can define the import creation graph prototype there as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>For Images</li>
<li>For Materials</li>
<li>For Meshes</li>
</ul>
<p>Every DCC asset allows changing of the extraction configuration. Therefore it is possible to define the extraction locations for outputs, images and materials.</p>
<p>Instead of importing assets and change their the configuration per asset , it is possible to define them per folder. All you need to do is add an &quot;<em>Import Settings Asset</em>&quot; in the correct folder. This can be done via the asset browser. <strong>Right Click -&gt; New -&gt; Import Settings</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_8A68AE93396574AC0D937BFA8CFC626D302DBC4E0617A82A7B5162043ADD88EF_1615469368165_image.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> worth noting that this is somewhat of a power-user feature and not something you need to have a detailed
understanding of to get started working with The Machinery.</p>

<p>The Machinery allows to share and remix the content of projects made within the Engine via the import project feature.</p>
<p><em>Project Import</em> provides an easy way to import assets from one The Machinery project to another. To use it, select <strong>File &gt; Import File…</strong> and pick a The Machinery project file to import. The project you select is opened in a new <em>Import Project</em> tab and from there, you can simply drag-and-drop or copy/paste assets into your main project’s <em>Asset Browser</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://ourmachinery.com/images/beta_20_11__import_project.png" alt="Importing assets from another project." /></p>
<p><em>Importing assets from another project.</em></p>
<p>When you drag-and-drop or copy-paste some assets, all their dependencies are automatically dragged along so that they are ready to use.</p>
<p>Here is a video showing this in action. We start with a blank project, then we drag in a level from the physics sample and a character from the animation sample, put them both in the same scene, and play:</p>
<iframe frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0"width="788.54" height="443" type="text/html" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gJpieDfxXQ0?autoplay=0&fs=0&iv_load_policy=3&showinfo=0&rel=0&cc_load_policy=0&start=0&end=0&origin=ourmachinery.com"></iframe>
<p>To make it even easier to share your stuff, we’ve also added <strong>File &gt; Import from URL…</strong> This lets you import any file that The Machinery understands: GLTF, FBX, JPEG, or a complete The Machinery project directly from an URL. You can even import zipped resource directories in the same way.</p>
<p>For example, in the image below, we imported a Curiosity selfie from NASA (using the URL <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/curiosity_selfie.jpg">https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/curiosity_selfie.jpg</a> ) and dropped it into the scene we just created:</p>
<p><img src="https://ourmachinery.com/images/beta_20_11__import_jpeg.png" alt="JPEG imported from URL." /></p>
<p><em>JPEG imported from URL.</em></p>
<p>Have you made something interesting in <em>The Machinery</em> that you want to share with the world? Save your project as an <em>Asset Database</em> and upload it to a web server somewhere. </p>
<p>Other people can use the <em>Import from URL…</em> option to bring your assets into their own projects.</p>

<p>This section we focus on how to set up a simple entity from an imported <code>dcc_asset</code>. </p>
<p>You will learn the basics about:</p>
<ul>
<li>What the creation graph is</li>
<li>How the asset pipeline works</li>
<li>How to create (rigg) an Entity from an imported asset</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="introduction"><a class="header" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>There are lots of things you might want to do to an imported asset coming from a DCC-tool. For
example, extracting images and materials into a representation that can be further tweaked by your
artists or rigging (create) an entity from the meshes present in the asset. In The Machinery, we provide full
control over how data enters the engine and what data-processing steps that get executed, allowing
technical artists to better optimize content and set up custom, game-specific asset pipelines.</p>
<p>This is handled through <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book/creation_graphs/concept.html"><em>Creation Graphs</em></a>. A <em>Creation Graph</em> is essentially a generic framework for
processing arbitrary data on the CPUs and GPUs, exposed through a graph front-end view. While we can
use <em>Creation Graphs</em> for any type of data processing. </p>

<h2 id="importing-a-dcc-asset"><a class="header" href="#importing-a-dcc-asset">Importing a DCC asset</a></h2>
<p>You can import an asset by selecting <strong>File &gt; Import...</strong> in the main menu, pressing <strong>Ctrl-I</strong>, or dropping a DCC file on the Asset Browser tab. When you do this, it ends up in our data-model as a <code>dcc_asset</code>. </p>
<p>For a more in detail explanation about how to import assets checkout the <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book/editing_workflows/import_assets.html">Asset Import Part</a>.</p>
<h3 id="basic-entity-rigging-with-image-and-material-extraction"><a class="header" href="#basic-entity-rigging-with-image-and-material-extraction">Basic entity rigging, with image and material extraction</a></h3>
<p>If you click on a <code>dcc_asset</code> that contains a mesh in the Asset Browser, you will be presented
with importer settings in the Properties tab:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/n6njdkl84dzem8n/dcc-asset-before-entity-rig.png?dl=1" alt="Inspecting a dcc_asset" /></p>
<p>The Preview tab does just enough to show you what the <code>dcc_asset</code> contains, but what you probably
want is an <code>entity</code> that contains child entities representing the meshes found inside the
<code>dcc_asset</code>. Also, you probably want it to extract the images and materials from the <code>dcc_asset</code> so
you can continue to tweak those inside The Machinery. There are two ways to do this. Either you drag
the DCC asset onto the <em>Scene Tab</em>, or you click the <em>Import Asset</em> button. The <em>Import Assets</em>
button will automatically create a prototype Entity Asset in your project, while dropping it into
the scene will rig the entity inside the scene, without creating a prototype.</p>
<p>In either case, we will for our <code>door.dcc_asset</code> get a <code>door.resources</code> directory next to it. This
directory will contain materials and images extracted from the DCC asset. If you prefer dropping
the assets into the scene directly, but also want an entity prototype, then you can check the
<code>Create Prototype on Drop</code> check box.</p>
<p>Each image and material in the resources folder is a <em>Creation Graph</em>, which is responsible for the
data-processing of those resources. You can inspect these graphs to see what each one does. They are
described in more detail below.</p>

<h3 id="creation-graphs-for-dcc_asset-import"><a class="header" href="#creation-graphs-for-dcc_asset-import">Creation Graphs for <code>dcc_asset</code> import</a></h3>
<p>In The Machinery, there are no specific asset types for images or materials, instead, we only have
<em>Creation Graphs</em> (<code>.creation</code> assets). To extract data from a <code>dcc_asset</code> in a creation graph, the
<code>dcc_asset</code>-plugin exposes a set of helper nodes in the <em>DCC Asset</em> category:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>DCC Asset/DCC Image</code> -- Takes the source <code>dcc_asset</code> together with the name of the image as input
and outputs a <code>GPU Image</code> that can be wired into various data processing nodes (such as mipmap
generation through the <code>Image/Filter Image</code> node) or directly to a shader node.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DCC Asset/DCC Material</code> -- Takes the source <code>dcc_asset</code> together with the name of the material as
input and outputs all properties of the material model found inside the <code>dcc_asset</code>. This material
representation is a close match to GLTF 2.0's PBR material model. Image outputs are references to
other <code>.creation</code> assets which in turn output <code>GPU Images</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DCC Asset/DCC Mesh</code> -- Takes the source <code>dcc_asset</code> together with the name of the mesh as input
and outputs a <code>GPU Geometry</code> that can be wired to an <code>Output/Draw Call</code> output node for rendering
together with the minimum and maximum extents of the geometry that can be wired to an
<code>Output/Bounding Volume</code> output node for culling.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The steps for extracting images and material <code>.creation</code> assets from a <code>dcc_asset</code> involve deciding
what data-processing should be done to the data before it gets wired to an output node of the graph.
This can either be done by manually assembling creation graphs for each image and material, or by
building a generic creation graph for each asset <em>type</em> and use that as a prototype when running a
batch processing step we refer to as <em>Resource Extraction</em>.</p>
<p>Here's an example of what a generic creation graph prototype for extracting images might look like:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/z2e3s5w1h8yiv1k/image-cg.png?dl=1" alt="Simple image processing." /></p>
<p>To quickly get up and running we provide a number of pre-authored creation graphs for some of the
more common operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>import-image</code>-- Operations applied to images imported directly into the editor (not as part of a
<code>dcc-asset</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>dcc-image</code> -- Operations applied to images extracted from an imported <code>dcc_asset</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>dcc-material</code> -- Shader graph setup to represent materials extracted from an imported <code>dcc_asset</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>dcc-mesh</code> -- Operations for generating a draw call that represents a mesh from an imported <code>dcc_asset</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>drop-image</code> -- Operations for generating a draw call to display the image output of another
creation graph in the context of an entity, making it possible to drag-and-drop images into the
Scene Tab.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These pre-authored creation graphs are shipped as part of our Core project which is automatically
copied into new projects. How they are used when working with assets is exposed through the
<code>import_settings</code> asset:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/sr52qac8i1i757l/import-settings.png?dl=1" alt="Default Import Settings." /></p>
<p>By exposing these settings through an asset it is possible to easily change the default behavior of
how imported assets are treated when placed under a specific folder. </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> It's worth noting that this is somewhat of a power-user feature and not something you need to have a detailed

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="meshes--materials--shaders"><a class="header" href="#meshes--materials--shaders">Meshes / Materials / Shaders</a></h1>
<p>In the Machinery Creation Graphs represent Meshes, Materials and Shaders all at the same time.</p>
<p>The creation graph is (as the name implies) a graph based tool for creating assets. It allows developers to define and alter various types of assets using visual scripting. More broadly speaking, the creation graph can be used for arbitrary data processing tasks.</p>
<p>A creation graph thus defines the asset’s pipeline into its final state. For instance, an image asset will have a file that defines the data of the image, but the creation graph asset specifies how that data should be processed. Should it generate mipmaps, should it be compressed, do we need a CPU copy of it, etc.</p>
<p>A more familiar example might be a material shader. In The Machinery this is also defined using a creation graph. This case maps very well to Unity’s shader assets and Unreal’s material assets. In the image below you can see a simple default material with a saturated red base color.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/w5ty4r8tttntt0t/tm_guide_creation_graph_simple_material.png?dl=1" alt="Simple red material" /></p>
<p>Image loading and material creation are just a few examples of what can be achieved with the creation graph. The table below shows when a creation graph is used compared to the tools one could use in Unity and Unreal.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Asset Type</th><th>Unity</th><th>Unreal</th><th>The Machinery</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Images</td><td>Texture</td><td>Texture</td><td>Creation graphs</td></tr>

<tr><td>Procedural materials</td><td>Procedural Materials</td><td>Material</td><td>Creation graphs</td></tr>
<tr><td>Meshes</td><td>Mesh</td><td>Static Mesh</td><td>DCC Asset + <br>Creation graphs</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Another example for the creation graph is mesh processing. A graph like this will define how the mesh should be draw or traced against. The graph below takes two inputs, a material creation graph and the mesh data from a DCC asset. This data is than imported and passed to the various outputs of our mesh pipeline. In this case those are: a ray tracing instance, a normal draw call, a bounding volume, and a physics shape. Note that not all of these outputs have to be used, rather the code that uses this creation graph might only look for the rendering outputs and ignore the physics shape, whilst some other code might only care about the physics shape output.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/103bvtqaz6lnsog/tm_guide_creation_graph_mesh_processing.png?dl=1" alt="Mesh processing" /></p>
<p>Like the entity graph, the creation graph can executes nodes in sequence from an event. Some examples of this are the <code>Tick</code>, <code>Init</code>, and <code>Compile</code> events which are executed at known intervals. Most of the creation graphs however work with a reverse flow, compiling the graph into a sequence of nodes for a specific output. The two examples presented earlier show this workflow. Some outputs are: <code>Draw Call</code>, <code>Shader Instance</code>, <code>Image</code>, and <code>Physics Shape</code>. Note that these outputs are just blobs of data, an implementation can define more output type in code.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="prototypes"><a class="header" href="#prototypes">Prototypes</a></h2>
<p>The Machinery has a prototype system that allows entity assets to be used inside
other entities. </p>

<p>So you can for example create an entity asset that represents a
room, and then create a house entity that has a bunch of these room entities
placed into it:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/2hpnogh7bff9jge/house-entity.png?dl=1" alt="Three Room entities placed to form a House entity." /></p>
<h2 id="difference-between-a-prototype-an-instance-and-an-asset"><a class="header" href="#difference-between-a-prototype-an-instance-and-an-asset">Difference between a Prototype, an Instance and an Asset</a></h2>
<p>We call the room asset a <em>prototype</em>, and we call each placed room entity an
<em>instance</em> of that prototype. Note that prototypes are not special assets, any
entity asset can be used as a prototype, with instances of it placed in another
entity asset.</p>
<p>In the Entity Tree tab, prototype instances are shown in yellow to distinguish them from locally
owned child entities (which are shown in white).</p>
<h2 id="instance-properties-inspect"><a class="header" href="#instance-properties-inspect">Instance Properties: Inspect</a></h2>
<p>If you expand an instance you will notice that most of its components and child entities are grayed
out and can't be selected. This is because they are inherited from the prototype, and the prototype
controls their values. If the prototype is modified — for example if we scatter some more props on
the floor — those changes are reflected everywhere the prototype has been placed. In the example
above, all three room instances would get the scattered objects.</p>
<h2 id="instance-properties-override"><a class="header" href="#instance-properties-override">Instance Properties: Override</a></h2>
<p>If we want to, however, we can choose to <em>override</em> some of the prototype’s
properties. When we override a property, we modify its value for <em>this instance</em>
of the prototype only. Other instances will keep the value from the prototype.</p>
<p>To initiate an override, right-click (or double click) the component or child entity whose
properties you want to override and choose <strong>Override</strong> in the context
menu. In addition to modifying properties, you can also add or remove components
or child entities on the overridden entity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you override the property of some node deep in the hierarchy of the placed entity, all its
parents will automatically get overridden too. Let's modify the position of the barrel in the
front-most room:</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/uy0rzwhrjzen42i/override.png?dl=1" alt="Barrel position overridden." /></p>
<p>The overridden entities and components are drawn in blue. We change the x and z components of the
position to move the barrel. Note how the changed values are shown in white, while the values that
are inherited from the prototype are shown in gray.</p>
<p>If you look back to the first picture you will see that the Link Component was
automatically overridden when the prototype was instanced. This is needed
because if we didn’t override the Link Component, it would use the values from
the prototype, which means all three room instances would be placed in the same
position.</p>
<p>When we override something on an instance, all the things not explicitly
overridden are still inherited from the prototype. If we modify the prototype —
for example change the barrel to a torch — all instances will get the change,
since it was only the x and z positions of the object that we changed.</p>
<h2 id="instance-properties-reset-or-propagate"><a class="header" href="#instance-properties-reset-or-propagate">Instance Properties: Reset or Propagate</a></h2>
<p>The context menus can be used to perform other prototype operations. For example,
you can <strong>Reset</strong> properties back to the prototype values. You can also
<strong>Propagate</strong> the changes you have made to an overridden component or entity
back to the prototype so that all instances get the changes. Finally, you can
<strong>Remove</strong> the overrides and get the instance back to being an exact replica of
the prototype.</p>
<h2 id="other-forms-of-prototypes-eg-graphs"><a class="header" href="#other-forms-of-prototypes-eg-graphs">Other forms of prototypes: e.g. Graphs</a></h2>
<p>Prototypes can also be used for other things than entities. For example, if you have a graph that
you want to reuse in different places you can create a Graph Asset to hold the graph, and then
instantiate that asset in the various places where you want to use it. Just as with the entity
instances, you can override specific nodes in the graph instance to customize the behavior.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="simulation"><a class="header" href="#simulation">Simulation</a></h2>
<p>In <em>The Machinery</em>, we make a distinction between <em>simulating</em> and <em>editing</em>. When you are <em>editing</em>,
you see a static view of the scene. All the runtime behaviors like physics, animation, destruction,
entity spawning, etc are disabled. (Editing the scene with everything moving around would be very
tricky.)</p>
<p>In contrast, when you are <em>simulating</em> or <em>running</em>, all the dynamic behaviors are enabled. This
allows you to see the runtime behavior of your entities. If you are building a game, the simulation
mode would correspond to running the game.</p>
<p>To <em>simulate</em> a scene, open a scene in the <em>Simulate</em> tab.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/7t8elpzqllqkqrb/simulate-tab.png?dl=1" alt="Simulate tab." /></p>
<p>You can use the controls in the tab to pause, play, or restart the simulation or change the
simulation speed. Note that if you haven't added any simulation components to the scene, the
<em>Simulate</em> tab will be just as static as the Scene tab. In order to get something to happen, you
need to add some runtime components.</p>
<p>The <em>Entity Graph</em> gives you a visual scripting language for controlling entity behavior. It will
be described in the next section.</p>
<p>You can launch the engine in simulation mode from the command line:</p>
<pre><code>the-machinery.exe --load-project project.the_machinery --simulate scene
</code></pre>
<p>Here <code>project.the_machinery</code> should be the name of your project file and <code>scene</code> the name of the
entity you want to simulate. This will open a window with just the <em>Simulate</em> tab, simulating the
scene that you specified.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="entity-graphs"><a class="header" href="#entity-graphs">Entity Graphs</a></h2>
<p>The <em>Entity Graph</em> implements a visual scripting language based on nodes and connections. To use
it, right-click on an entity to add a Graph Component and then double click on the Graph Component
to open it in the Graph Editor:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ssasbp5sb0vq7gy/graph-editor.png?dl=1" alt="Graph editor." /></p>
<p>The visual scripting language uses <em>Events</em> to tick the execution of nodes. For example, the
<em>Tick Event</em> node will trigger its out connector whenever the application ticks its frame. Connect
its output event connector to another node to run that node during the application's update.</p>
<p>Nodes that just fetch data and don't have any side-effects are considered &quot;pure&quot;. They don't have
any event connectors and will run automatically whenever their data is needed by one of the non-pure
nodes. Connect the data connectors with wires to pass data between nodes.</p>
<p>In addition to connecting wires, you can also edit input data on the nodes directly. Click a node
to select it and edit its input data in the properties.</p>
<p>There are a lot of different nodes in the system and I will not attempt to describe all of them.
Instead, here is a simple example that adds a super simple animation to an entity using the graph
component:</p>

<h2 id="the-physics-simulation-system"><a class="header" href="#the-physics-simulation-system">The physics simulation system</a></h2>
<p>The physics simulation system introduces two new assets: <em>Physics Material</em> and <em>Physics Collision</em>
as well as four new components: <em>Physics Shape Component</em>, <em>Physics Body Component</em>, <em>Physics
Joint Component</em>, and <em>Physics Mover Component</em>.</p>
<h3 id="physics-assets"><a class="header" href="#physics-assets">Physics Assets</a></h3>
<p>A <em>Physics Material</em> asset specifies the physical properties of a physics object: <em>friction</em> (how
&quot;slippery&quot; the object is) and <em>restitution</em> (how &quot;bouncy&quot; the object is). Note that if you don't
assign a material to a physics shape it will get default values for <em>friction</em> and <em>constitution</em>.</p>
<p>A <em>Physics Collision</em> asset describes a <em>collision class</em>. <em>Collision Classes</em> control which physics
shapes collide with each other. For example, a common thing to do is to have a <em>debris</em> class for
small objects and set it up so that <em>debris</em> collide with regular objects, but not with other
<em>debris</em>. That way, you are not wasting resources on computing collisions between lots of tiny
objects. (Note that the debris objects still need to collide with regular objects, or they would
just fall through the world.)</p>
<p>In addition to deciding who collides with who, the collision class also decides which collisions
generate callback events. These events can be handled in the <em>Entity Graph</em>.</p>
<p>If you don't assign a collision class to a physics shape, it will get the <em>Default</em> collision class.</p>
<h3 id="physics-components"><a class="header" href="#physics-components">Physics Components</a></h3>
<p>The <em>Physics Shape Component</em> can be added to an entity to give it a collision shape for physics.
Entities with shape components will collide with each other when physics is simulated.</p>
<p>A physics shape can either be specified as geometry (sphere, capsule, plane, box) or it can be
computed from a graphics mesh (convex, mesh). Note that if you use computed geometry, you must press
the <strong>Cook</strong> button in the Properties UI to explicitly compute the geometry for the object.</p>
<p><img src="editing_workflows/physics.html#" alt="Convex shape." /></p>
<p>If you just give an entity a <em>Physics Shape Component</em> it will become a static physics object. Other
moving objects can still collide with it, but the object itself won't move.</p>
<p>To create a moving physics object, you need to add a <em>Physics Body Component</em>. The body component
lets you specify dynamic properties such as damping, mass, and inertia tensor. It also lets you
specify whether the object should be <em>kinematic</em> or not. A <em>kinematic</em> object is being moved by
<em>animation</em>. Its movement is not affected by physics, but it can still affect other physical
objects by colliding with them and pushing them around. In contrast, if the object is <em>not
kinematic</em> it will be completely controlled by physics. If you place it above ground, it will fall
down as soon as you start the simulation.</p>
<p>Note that parameters such as <em>damping</em> and <em>mass</em> do not really affect kinematic objects, since
the animations will move them the same way, regardless of their mass or damping. However, these
parameters can still be important because gameplay code could at some point change the object
from being kinematic to non-kinematic. If the gameplay code never makes the body non-kinematic, the
mass doesn't matter.</p>
<p>The <em>Physics Joint Component</em> can be used to add <em>joints</em> to the physics simulation. Joints can tie
together physics bodies in various ways. For example, if you tie together two bodies with a hinge
joint they will swing as if they were connected by a hinge. For a more thorough description of
joints, we refer to the PhysX documentation.</p>
<p>The <em>Physics Mover Component</em> implements a physics-based character controller. If you add it to an
entity, it will keep the entity's feet on the ground, prevent it from going through walls, etc. For
an example of how to use the character controller, check out the <code>animation</code> or <code>gameplay</code> sample
projects.</p>
<h2 id="physics-scripting"><a class="header" href="#physics-scripting">Physics scripting</a></h2>
<p>Physics can be scripted using the visual scripting language in the <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book/editing_workflows/visual-scripting.html"><em>Entity Graph</em></a>.</p>
<p>We can divide the PhysX scripting nodes into a few categories.</p>
<p><strong>Nodes that query the state of a physics body:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Get Angular Velocity</li>
<li>Get Velocity</li>
<li>Is Joint Broken</li>
<li>Is Kinematic</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Nodes that manipulate physics bodies:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Add Force</li>
<li>Add Torque</li>
<li>Break Joint</li>
<li>Push</li>
<li>Set Angular Velocity</li>
<li>Set Kinematic</li>
<li>Set Velocity</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Event nodes that get triggered when something happens in the scene:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>On Contact Event</li>
<li>On Joint Break Event</li>
<li>On Trigger Event</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Nodes that query the world for physics bodies:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Overlap</li>
<li>Raycast</li>
<li>Sweep</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong> that the query nodes may return more than one result. They will do that by triggering their
<em>Out</em> event multiple times, each time with one of the result objects. (In the future we might change
this and have the nodes actually return arrays of objects.)</p>

<h2 id="missing-features"><a class="header" href="#missing-features">Missing Features</a></h2>
<p>Note that The Machinery doesn't currently support all the features found in PhysX. The most
glaring omissions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>D6 joints and joint motors.</li>
<li>Vehicles.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will add more support going forward.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="animation"><a class="header" href="#animation">Animation</a></h2>
<p>The <em>Animation</em> system lets you play animations on entities. You can also create complicated
animation blends, crossfades, and transitions using an <em>Animation State Machine</em>.</p>
<p>The animation system adds two new assets to The Machinery: <em>Animation Clip</em> and <em>Animation State
Machine</em> as well as two new components: <em>Animation Simple Player</em> and <em>Animation State Machine</em>.</p>
<p>To get an animation into <em>The Machinery</em> you first export it from your DCC tool as FBX or another
suitable file format. Then you import this using <strong>File &gt; Import...</strong>.</p>
<p>An <em>Animation Clip</em> is an asset created from an imported DCC animation asset that adds some
additional data. First, you can set a range of the original animation to use for the clip, so you
can cut up a long animation into several individual clips. Second, you can specify whether the
animation should loop or not as well as its playback speed. You can use a negative playback speed to
get a &quot;reverse&quot; animation.</p>
<p>Finally, you can specify a &quot;locomotion&quot; node for the animation. If you do, the delta motion of that
node will be extracted from the animation and applied to the <em>entity</em> that animation is played on,
instead of to that bone. This lets an animation &quot;drive&quot; the entity and is useful for things like
walking and running animations. The locomotion node should typically be the root node of the
skeleton. If the root mode is animated and you &quot;don't&quot; specify a locomotion node, the result will be
that the root node &quot;walks away&quot; from the animation.</p>

  frameborder="0"></iframe>
<p>The <em>Animation Simple Player Component</em> is a component that you can add to an entity to play
animations on it. The component lets you pick a single animation to play on the entity. This is
useful when you want to play simple animations such as doors opening, coins spinning, flags waving,
etc. If you want more control over the playback and be able to crossfade and blend between
animations you should use an <em>Animation State Machine</em> instead.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h3 id="animation-state-machines"><a class="header" href="#animation-state-machines">Animation state machines</a></h3>
<p>The <em>Animation State Machine Asset</em> represents an <em>Animation State Machine</em>. If you double-click an
Animation State Machine Asset in the Asset Browser, an Animation State Machine Editor will open:</p>
<p><img src="editing_workflows/animation/animation-state-machine.html#" alt="Animation State Machine Editor" /></p>
<p>The Animation State Machine (ASM) introduces a number of concepts: <em>Layers</em>, <em>States</em>,
<em>Transitions</em>, <em>Events</em>, <em>Variables</em>, and <em>Blend Sets</em>.</p>
<p>The ASM represents a complex animation setup with multiple animations that can be played on a
character by dividing it into <em>States</em>. Each state represents something the character is doing
(running, walking, swimming, jumping, etc) and in each state, one particular animation, or a
particular blend of animations is being played. The states are the boxes in the <em>State Graph</em>.</p>
<p>The ASM can change state by taking a <em>Transition</em> from one state to another. The transitions are
represented by arrows in the graph. When the transition is taken, the animation crossfades over from
the animations in one state to the animations in the other state. The properties of the transition
specify the crossfade time. Note that even though the crossfade takes some time, the logical <em>state
transition</em> is immediate. I.e. as soon as the transition is taken, the state machine will logically
be in the new state.</p>
<p>The transitions are triggered by <em>Events</em>. An event is simply a named thing that can be sent to the
ASM from gameplay code. For example, the gameplay may send a &quot;jump&quot; event and that triggers the
animation to transition to the &quot;jump&quot; state.</p>
<p><em>Variables</em> are float values that can be set from gameplay code to affect how the animations play.
The variables can be used in the states to affect their playback. For example, you may create a
variable called <code>run_speed</code> and set the playback <em>Speed</em> of your <em>run</em> state to be <code>run_speed</code>.
That way, gameplay can control the speed of the animation.</p>
<p>Note that the <em>Speed</em> of a state can be set to a fixed number, a variable, or a mathematical
expression using variables and numbers. (E.g. <code>run_speed * 2</code>.) We have a small expression language
that we use to evaluate these expressions.</p>
<p>The ASM supports multiple <em>Layers</em> of state graphs. This works similar to image layering in an
application such as Photoshop. Animations in &quot;higher&quot; layers will be played &quot;on top&quot; of animations
in the lower layers and hide them.</p>
<p>As an example of how to use layering, you could have a bottom layer that controls the player's basic
locomotion (walking, running, etc). Then you could have a second layer on top of that for
controlling arm movements. That way, you could play a reload animation on the arms while the legs
are still running. Finally, you could have a top layer to play &quot;hurt&quot; animations when the player for
example gets hit by a bullet. These hurt animations could then interrupt the reload animations
whenever the player got hit.</p>
<p><em>Blend Sets</em> can be used to control the per-bone opacity of animations playing in higher layers.
They simply specify a weight for each bone. In the example above, the animations in the &quot;arm
movement&quot; layer would have opacity 1.0 for all arm bones, but 0.0 for all leg bones. That way, they
would hide the arm movement from the running animation below, but let the leg movement show through.</p>
<p>The Animation State Machine Editor has a <em>Tree View</em> to the left that lets you browse all the
layers, states, transitions, events, variables, and blend sets. The <em>State Graph</em> lets you edit the
states and transitions in the current layer. The <em>Properties</em> window lets you set the properties of
the currently selected objects and the <em>Preview</em> shows you a preview of what the animation looks
like. Note that for the preview to work, you must specify a <em>Preview Entity</em> in the properties of
the state machine. This is the entity that will be used to preview the ASM. When you select a state
in the <em>State Graph</em>, the preview will update to show that state.</p>
<p>In the <em>Preview</em> window, you also find the <em>Motion Mixer</em>. This allows you to send events to the ASM
and change variables to see how the animation reacts.</p>
<p>The ASM currently supports the following animation states:</p>
<p><strong>Regular State</strong></p>
<p>Plays a regular animation.</p>
<p><strong>Random State</strong></p>
<p>Randomly plays an animation out of a set of options.</p>
<p><strong>Empty State</strong></p>
<p>A state that doesn't play any animation at all. Note that this state is only useful in higher layers.
You can transition to an empty state to &quot;clear&quot; the animation in the layer and let the animations from
the layers below it shine through.</p>
<p><strong>Blend State</strong></p>
<p>Allows you to make a 1D or 2D blend between animations based on the value of variables. This is often
used for locomotion. You can use different animations based on the characters running speed and whether
the character is turning left or right and position them on a map to blend between them.</p>
<p><img src="editing_workflows/animation/animation-state-machine.html#" alt="Animation Blending" /></p>
<p>Once you have created an Animation State Machine, you can assign it to a character by giving it an
Animation State Machine Component.</p>
<p>For an example of how the animation system works, have a look at the <code>mannequin</code> sample project.</p>
<h3 id="missing-features-1"><a class="header" href="#missing-features-1">Missing features</a></h3>
<p>Note that the animation system is still under active development. Here are some features that are
planned for the near future:</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="animation-compression"><a class="header" href="#animation-compression">Animation Compression</a></h2>
<p>We support compressed animations. Compressed animations have the extension <code>.animation</code>. Note that with this, we have three kinds of animation resources:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th><strong>Resource</strong></th><th><strong>Description</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><code>.dcc_asset</code></td><td>Animation imported from a Digital Content Creation (DCC) software, such as Max, Maya, Blender, etc. Note  that <code>.dcc_asset</code> is used for all imported content, so it could be animations, textures, models, etc.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>.animation</code></td><td>A compressed animation. The compressed animation is generated from the <code>.dcc_asset</code> by explicitly compressing it.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>.animation_clip</code></td><td>Specifies how an animation should be played: playback speed, whether it plays forward or backward, if it drives the root bone or not, etc.<br><br>An <em>Animation Clip</em> references either an uncompressed <code>.dcc_asset</code> or a compressed <code>.animation</code> to access the actual animation data.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>To create a compressed animation, right-click a <code>.dcc_asset</code> file that contains an animation and choose <strong>Create xxx.animation</strong> in the context menu:</p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_AF44CABDD4BF19FA7D54C2D4574B155CAAE2ED895AFB490AC3671972A5F81DC2_1617123138052_image.png" alt="A compressed animation." /></p>
<p>When you first do this, the animation shows a white skeleton in T-pose and a moving blue skeleton. The blue skeleton is the reference <code>.dcc_animation</code> and the white skeleton is the compressed animation. By comparing the skeletons you can see how big the error in the animation is.</p>
<p>At first, the white skeleton is in T-pose because we haven’t actually generated the compressed data yet. To do that, press the <strong>Compress</strong> button:</p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_AF44CABDD4BF19FA7D54C2D4574B155CAAE2ED895AFB490AC3671972A5F81DC2_1617123319435_image.png" alt="Compressed animation with data." /></p>
<p>This will update the <strong>Format</strong> and <strong>Buffer</strong> fields and we can see that we have 9.2 KB of compressed data for this animation and that the compression ratio is x 6.66. I.e, the compressed data is 6.66 times smaller than the uncompressed one. The white and the blue skeletons overlap. The compression error is too small to be noticed in this view, we have to really zoom in to see it:</p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_AF44CABDD4BF19FA7D54C2D4574B155CAAE2ED895AFB490AC3671972A5F81DC2_1617123494752_image.png" alt="Zoomed in view of one of the fingers." /></p>
<p>When you compress an animation like this, The Machinery tries to come up with some good default compression settings. The default settings work in a lot of cases, but they’re not perfect,
because The Machinery can’t know how the animation is intended to be viewed in your game.</p>
<p>Are you making a miniature fighting game, and all the models will be viewed from a distant overhead camera? In that case, you can get away with a lot of compression. Or are you animating a gun sight that will be held up really close to the player’s eye? In that case, a small error will be very visible.</p>
<p>To help the engine, you can create an <code>.animation_compression</code> asset. (<strong>New Animation Compression</strong> in the asset browser.) The Animation Compression asset control the settings for all the animations in the same folder or in its subfolders (unless the subfolders override with a local Animation Compression asset):</p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_AF44CABDD4BF19FA7D54C2D4574B155CAAE2ED895AFB490AC3671972A5F81DC2_1617124020292_image.png" alt="Animation Compression settings." /></p>
<p>The Animation Compression settings object has two properties:</p>
<p><strong>Max Error</strong> specifies the maximum allowed error in the compressed animation. The default value is 0.001 or 1 mm. This means that when we do the compression we allow bones to be off by 1 mm, but not more. The lower you set this value, the less compression you will get.</p>
<p><strong>Skin Size</strong> specifies the size we assume for the character’s skin. It defaults to 0.1, or 10 cm. We need the skin size to estimate the effects of rotational errors. For example, if the rotation of a bone is off by 1°, the effect of that in mm depends on how far away from the bone the mesh is.</p>
<p>10 cm is a reasonable approximation for a human character, but notice that there are situations where the skin size can be significantly larger. For example, suppose that a 3 m long staff is attached to the player’s hand bone. In this case, rotational errors in the hand are amplified by the full length of the staff and can lead to really big errors in the position of the staff end. If this gives you trouble, you might want to up the skin size to 3 for animations with the staff.</p>
<p>We don’t support setting a per-bone skin size, because it’s unclear if the effort of specifying per-bone skin sizes is really worth it in terms of the memory savings it can give. (Also, even a per-bone skin size might not be enough to estimate errors perfectly. For example, an animator could have set up a miter joint where the extent of the skin depends on the relative angle of two bones and goes to infinity as the angle approaches zero.)</p>
<p>Note that sometimes animations are exported in other units than meters. In this case, the Skin Size and the Max Error should be specified in the same units that are used in the animation file.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="sound"><a class="header" href="#sound">Sound</a></h2>
<p>The Machinery comes with a low-level sound system that can import WAV files into the project and
play them back. The sound system can position sounds in 3D space and mix together 2D and 3D sounds
for output on a stereo, 5.1, or 7.1 sound system.</p>
<p>You can play a sound by adding a <em>Sound Source Component</em> to an object in the level of by using one
of the sound playing nodes in the visual scripting language.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This tool is in a preview state.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the Sculpt Tool The Machinery supports rapid prototyping when it comes to level white boxing. You make use of the tool by adding a Sculpt Component to an Entity. Using the sculpt component you can quickly sketch out levels or make beautiful blocky art:</p>
<p><img src="https://ourmachinery.com/images/beta_20_11__blocky.png" alt="A blocky character in a blocky forest setting." /></p>
<p><em>A blocky character in a blocky forest setting.</em></p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-the-tool"><a class="header" href="#how-to-use-the-tool">How to use the Tool</a></h2>
<p>To use the Sculpt Component, first add it to an entity, by right-clicking the entity in the <em>Entity Tree</em> and selecting <em>Add Component.</em> Then, select the newly created <em>Sculpt</em> component in the <em>Entity Tree</em>.</p>
<p>This gives you a new sculpt tool in the toolbar:</p>
<p><img src="https://ourmachinery.com/images/beta_20_11__sculpt_tool.png" alt="Sculpt tool." /></p>
<p><em>Sculpt tool.</em></p>
<p>With this tool selected, you can drag out prototype boxes on the ground. You can also drag on an existing prototype box to create boxes attached to that box.</p>
<p>The standard <em>Select</em>, <em>Move</em>, <em>Rotate,</em> and <em>Scale</em> tools can be used to move or clone (by shift-dragging) boxes.</p>
<p>You can add physics to your sculpts, by adding a <em>Physics Shape Component</em>, just as you would for any other object. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you are cooking a physics mesh or convex from your sculpt data, you need to explicitly recook whenever the sculpt data changes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is a video of sculpting in action:</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Currently, all the sculpting is done with boxes. We may add additional shape support in the future. </p>

<h2 id="additional-though"><a class="header" href="#additional-though">Additional though</a></h2>
<p>In addition to being a useful tool, the <em>Sculpt Component</em> also shows the deep integration you can get with custom plugins in The Machinery. The <em>Sculpt Component</em> is a separate plugin, completely isolated from the rest of The Machinery and if you wanted to, you could write your own plugins to do similar things.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-truth"><a class="header" href="#the-truth">The Truth</a></h1>
<p>The Machinery uses a powerful data model to represent edited assets. This model has built-in support for serialization, streaming, copy/paste, drag-and-drop as well as unlimited undo/redo. It supports an advanced hierarchical prefab model for making derivative object instances and propagating changes. It even has full support for real-time collaboration. Multiple people can work together in the same game project, Google Docs-style. Since all of these features are built into the data model itself, your custom, game-specific data will get them automatically, without you having to write a line of code.</p>
<h2 id="the-data-model"><a class="header" href="#the-data-model">The Data Model</a></h2>
<p>The Machinery stores its data as <strong>objects with properties</strong>. Each object has a type and the type defines what properties the object has. Available property types are <em>bools, integers, floats, strings, buffers, references</em>, <em>sub-objects</em> and <em>sets of references or sub-objects</em>.</p>
<p>The object/properties model gives us us <em>forward and backward compatibility</em> and allows us to implement operations such as <em>cloning</em> without knowing any details about the data. We can also represent modifications to the data in a uniform way <code>(object, property, old-value, new-value)</code> for undo/redo and collaboration.</p>
<p>The model is <strong>memory-based</strong> rather than disk-based. I.e. the in-memory representation of the data is considered <em>authoritative.</em> Read/write access to the data is provided by a thread-safe API. If two systems want to cooperate, they do so by talking to the same in-memory model, not by sharing files on disk. Of course, we still need to save data out disk at some point for persistence, but this is just a “backup” of the memory model and we might use different disk formats for different purposes (i.e. a git-friendly representation for collaborative work vs single binary for solo projects).</p>
<p>Since we have a memory-based model which supports cloning and change tracking, copy/paste and undo can be defined in terms of the data model. Real-time collaboration is also supported, by serializing modifications and transmitting them over the network. Since the runtime has equal access to the data model, modifying the data from within a VR session is also possible.</p>
<p>We make a clear <strong>distinction between “buffer data” and “object data”</strong>. <em>Object data</em> is stuff that can be reasoned about on a per-property level. I.e. if user A changes one property of an object, and user B changes another, we can merge those changes. <em>Buffer data</em> are binary blobs of data that are opaque to the data model. We use it for large pieces of binary data, such as textures, meshes and sound files. Since the data model cannot reason about the content of these blobs it can’t for example merge changes made to the same texture by different users.</p>
<p>Making the distinction between buffer data and object data is important because we pay an overhead for representing data as objects. We only want to pay that overhead when the benefits outweigh the costs. Most of a game’s data (in terms of bytes) is found in things like textures, meshes, audio data, etc and does not really gain anything from being stored in a JSON-like object tree.</p>
<p>In The Truth, <strong>references are represented by IDs</strong>. Each object has a unique ID and we reference other objects by their IDs. Since references have their own property type in The Truth, it is easy for us to reason about references and find all the dependencies of an object.</p>
<p>Sub-objects in The Truth are references to <em>owned</em> objects. They work just as references, but have special behaviours in some situations. For example, when an object is cloned, all its sub-objects will be cloned too, while its references will not.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="access-values"><a class="header" href="#access-values">Access values</a></h1>
<p>The truth objects (<a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/api_types.h.html#structtm_tt_id_t"><code>tm_tt_id_t</code></a>) are immutable objects unless you explicitly make them writable. Therefore you do not have to be afraid of accidentally changing a value when reading from an object property.</p>
<p>To read from an object property we need access to the correct Truth Instance as well as to an object id. We also need to know what kind of property we want to access. That is why we always want to define our properties in a Header-File. Which allows us and others to find quickly our type definitions. A good practice is to comment on what kind of data type property contains.</p>
<p>Let us assume our object is of type <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/the_truth_types.h.html#tm_tt_type__rect"><code>TM_TT_TYPE__RECT</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>enum {
    TM_TT_PROP__RECT__X, // float
    TM_TT_PROP__RECT__Y, // float
    TM_TT_PROP__RECT__W, // float
    TM_TT_PROP__RECT__H, // float
};
</code></pre>
<p>When we know what we want to access, we call the correct function and access the value. In our example we want to get the width of an object. The width is stored in <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/the_truth_types.h.html#enumtm_tt_prop__rect"><code>TM_TT_PROP__RECT__W</code></a>.</p>
<p>The function we need to call:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">void (*get_float)(tm_the_truth_o *tt,const tm_the_truth_object_o *obj, uint32_t property);
</code></pre>
<p>With this knowledge we can assemble the following function that logs the width of an object:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">void log_with(tm_the_truth_o *tt, tm_tt_id_t my_object){   
	const float width = tm_the_truth_api-&gt;get_float(tt,tm_tt_read(tt,my_object),TM_TT_PROP__RECT__W);
    TM_LOG(&quot;the width is %f&quot;,width);
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="make-the-code-robust"><a class="header" href="#make-the-code-robust">Make the code robust</a></h2>
<p>To ensure we are actually handling the right type we should check this at the beginning of our function. If the type is not correct we should early out and log a warning.</p>
<p>All we need to do is compare the <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/api_types.h.html#structtm_tt_type_t"><code>tm_tt_type_t</code></a>'s of our types. Therefore we need to obtain the type id from the object id and from our expected type. From a <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/api_types.h.html#structtm_tt_id_t"><code>tm_tt_id_t</code></a> we can obtain the type by calling <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/api_types.h.html#tm_tt_type()"><code>tm_tt_type()</code></a> on them. <code>tm_the_truth_api-&gt;object_type_from_name_hash(tt, TM_TT_TYPE_HASH__MY_TYPE);</code> will give us back the object type from a given hash. After that we can do our comparison.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">void log_with(tm_the_truth_o *tt, tm_tt_id_t my_object) {
  const tm_tt_type_t type = tm_tt_type(my_object);
  const tm_tt_type_t expected_type =
      tm_the_truth_api-&gt;object_type_from_name_hash(tt, TM_TT_TYPE_HASH__RECT);

  if (type.u64 != expected_type.u64) {
    TM_LOG(&quot;The provided type does not mmatch! %p{tm_tt_type_t} != &quot;
           &quot;%p{tm_tt_type_t}&quot;,
           &amp;type, &amp;expected_type);
    return;
  }

  const float width = tm_the_truth_api-&gt;get_float(tt, tm_tt_read(tt, my_object),
                                                  TM_TT_PROP__RECT__W);
  TM_LOG(&quot;the width is %f&quot;, width);

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="create-an-object"><a class="header" href="#create-an-object">Create an Object</a></h2>
<p>You can create an object of a Truth Type via two steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>You need to obtain the Type from the type hash. We call the <code>object_type_from_name_hash</code> to obtain the <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/api_types.h.html#structtm_tt_type_t"><code>tm_tt_type_t</code></a></li>
<li>You need to create an Object from that Type. We call <code>create_object_of_type</code> to create an object <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/api_types.h.html#structtm_tt_id_t"><code>tm_tt_id_t</code></a> . We pass <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/the_truth.h.html#tm_tt_no_undo_scope"><code>TM_TT_NO_UNDO_SCOPE</code></a> because we do not need an undo scope for our example.</li>
</ol>
<p>First, we need to have access to a Truth instance. Otherwise, we could not create an object. In this example, we create a function.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">tm_tt_id_t create_my_type_object(tm_the_truth_o *tt) {
  const tm_tt_type_t my_type = tm_the_truth_api-&gt;object_type_from_name_hash(
      tt, TM_TT_TYPE_HASH__MY_TYPE);
  const tm_tt_id_t my_type_object =
      tm_the_truth_api-&gt;create_object_of_type(tt, my_type, TM_TT_NO_UNDO_SCOPE);
  return my_type_object;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Wherever we call this function we can then edit and modify the type and add content to it!</p>
<p>The alternative approach is to use the &quot;Quick Object Creation function&quot;.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">tm_tt_id_t quick_create_my_type_object(tm_the_truth_o *tt) {
  return tm_the_truth_api-&gt;quick_create_object(tt, TM_TT_NO_UNDO_SCOPE,
                                               TM_TT_TYPE_HASH__MY_TYPE, -1);
}
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>  need to pass <code>-1</code> to tell the function that we are at the end of the creation process. More info <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/the_truth.h.html#structtm_the_truth_api.quick_create_object()">here</a>.</p>

<p>To manipulate an object, you need to have its ID (<a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/api_types.h.html#structtm_tt_id_t"><code>tm_tt_id_t</code></a>). When you create an object, you should keep its ID around if you intend to edit it later.</p>

<p>In this example, we have a function that gets an object and the Truth instance of that object.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">void modify_my_object(tm_the_truth_o *tt, tm_tt_id_t my_object) {}
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> you can only edit an object that is part of the same instance! Hence your <code>my_object</code> must be created within this instance of the Truth (<code>tt</code>).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="1-make-the-object-writable"><a class="header" href="#1-make-the-object-writable">1. Make the object writable</a></h2>
<p>To edit an object, we need to make it writable first. In the default state, objects from the Truth are immutable. The Truth API has a function that is called <code>write</code>. When we call it on an object, we make it writable.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">tm_the_truth_object_o *my_object_w = tm_the_truth_api-&gt;write(tt, my_object);
</code></pre>
<h2 id="2-write-to-the-object"><a class="header" href="#2-write-to-the-object">2. Write to the object.</a></h2>
<p>We need to know what kind of property we want to edit. That is why we always want to define our properties in a Header-File. A good practice is to comment on what kind of data type property contains.</p>
<p>Let us assume our object is of type <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/the_truth_types.h.html#tm_tt_type__rect"><code>TM_TT_TYPE__RECT</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>enum {
    TM_TT_PROP__RECT__X, // float
    TM_TT_PROP__RECT__Y, // float
    TM_TT_PROP__RECT__W, // float
    TM_TT_PROP__RECT__H, // float
};
</code></pre>
<p>In our example we want to set the width to <code>100</code>. The width is stored in <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/the_truth_types.h.html#enumtm_tt_prop__rect"><code>TM_TT_PROP__RECT__W</code></a>.</p>
<p>When we know what we want to edit, we call the correct function and change the value.</p>
<p>The function we need to call:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">void (*set_float)(tm_the_truth_o *tt, tm_the_truth_object_o *obj, uint32_t property,float value);
</code></pre>
<p>Let us bring all of this together:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">tm_the_truth_object_o *my_object_w = tm_the_truth_api-&gt;write(tt, my_object);
tm_the_truth_api-&gt;set_float(tt, my_object_w, TM_TT_PROP__RECT__W, 100);
</code></pre>
<h2 id="3-save-the-change"><a class="header" href="#3-save-the-change">3. Save the change</a></h2>
<p>In the end, we need to commit our change to the system. In this example we do not care about the undo scope. That is why we provide the <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/the_truth.h.html#tm_tt_no_undo_scope"><code>TM_TT_NO_UNDO_SCOPE</code></a> define. This means this action is not undoable.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">tm_the_truth_object_o *my_object_w = tm_the_truth_api-&gt;write(tt, my_object);
tm_the_truth_api-&gt;set_float(tt, my_object_w, TM_TT_PROP__RECT__W, 100);
tm_the_truth_api-&gt;commit(tt, my_object_w, TM_TT_NO_UNDO_SCOPE);
</code></pre>
<p>If we wanted to provide an undo scope we need to create one:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">tm_the_truth_object_o *my_object_w = tm_the_truth_api-&gt;write(tt, my_object);
tm_the_truth_api-&gt;set_float(tt, my_object_w, TM_TT_PROP__RECT__W, 100);
</code></pre>
<p>Now this action can be reverted in the Editor.</p>
<h2 id="4-get-a-value"><a class="header" href="#4-get-a-value">4. Get a value</a></h2>
<p>Instead of changing the value  of width to 100 we can also increment it by 100! All we need to do is get the value first of the Truth Object and add 100 to it. To access a property we need to use the macro <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/the_truth.h.html#tm_tt_read()"><code>tm_tt_read</code></a>. This will give us an immutable (read only) pointer to the underlying object. This allows us to read the data from it.</p>

  tm_the_truth_api-&gt;commit(tt, my_object_w, undo_scope);

<p>There is a helper API to handle all of these types in an easy way, to reduce the boilerplate code: <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/the_truth_types.h.html#structtm_the_truth_common_types_api"><code>tm_the_truth_common_types_api</code></a>. </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> There is a list of all Truth Types the Engine comes with available on our <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/truth_types.html">API Documentation</a></p>
</blockquote>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="aspects"><a class="header" href="#aspects">Aspects</a></h1>
<p>An “aspect” is an interface (struct of function pointers) identified by a unique identifier. The Truth allows you to associate aspects with object types. This lets you extend The Truth with new functionality. For example, you could add an interface for debug printing an object:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#define tm_debug_print_aspect_i_hash                                           \
  TM_STATIC_HASH(&quot;tm_debug_print_aspect_i&quot;, 0x39821c78639e0773ULL)

typedef struct tm_debug_print_aspect_i {
  void (*debug_print)(tm_the_truth_o *tt, tm_tt_id_t object);
} tm_debug_print_aspect_i;
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> to genereate the <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/api_types.h.html#tm_static_hash()"><code>TM_STATIC_HASH</code></a> you need to run <code>hash.exe</code> or <code>tmbuild.exe --gen-hash</code> for more info open the <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book//helper_tools/hash.html">hash.exe guide</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You could then use this code to debug print an object <code>o</code> with:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">static void example_use_case(tm_the_truth_o *tt, tm_tt_id_t object) {
  tm_debug_print_aspect_i *dp =
      tm_tt_get_aspect(tt, tm_tt_type(object), tm_debug_print_aspect_i);
  if (dp)
    dp-&gt;debug_print(tt, object);
}
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: that plugins can extend the system with completely new aspects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The best example of how the Engine is using the aspect system is the <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/plugins/editor_views/properties.h.html#structtm_properties_aspect_i"><code>tm_properties_aspect_i</code></a> which helps us to defines custom UIs for Truth objects.</p>

<p>This walkthrough shows you how to create a type for the Truth. The Truth is our centralized data model for editing data in the Engine. For more details on the system itself, click here: <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book/the_truth/index.html">The Truth</a>. </p>

<h2 id="define-a-type"><a class="header" href="#define-a-type">Define a Type</a></h2>
<p>A Truth-Type in The Machinery consists out of a name (its identifier) and properties. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In theory, you could also define a Type without properties.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To add a Type to the system, you need access to the Truth instance. The Engine may have more than one instance of a Truth. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> There is a Project Truth to keep all the project-related settings and an Engine/Application Truth that holds all the application-wide settings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Generally speaking, you want to define Truth Types at the beginning of the Engine's life cycle. Therefore the designated place is the <code>tm_load_plugin</code> function. The Truth has an <em>interface</em> to register a truth type creation function: <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/the_truth.h.html#tm_the_truth_create_types_i"><code>tm_the_truth_create_types_i</code></a>. </p>
<p>This interface expects a function of the signature: <code>void create_truth_types(tm_the_truth_o *tt)</code>. Whenever the Engine creates a Truth, it invokes this interface on all loaded plugins, and their types are registered. You do not need to register your Type to the interface if you want to register your Type to a specific Truth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Mostly this function is called: <code>create_truth_types</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us define a type. To do that, we need to get the <code>tm_truth_api</code> first:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">// beginning of the source file
static struct tm_the_truth_api *tm_the_truth_api;
#include &lt;foundation/api_registry.h&gt;
// include
// [macros.h](https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/macros.h.html#macros.h)
// to access TM_ARRAY_COUNT for convinace:
#include &lt;foundation/macros.h&gt;
#include &lt;foundation/the_truth.h&gt;
// ... other code
TM_DLL_EXPORT void tm_load_plugin(struct tm_api_registry_api *reg, bool load) {
  tm_the_truth_api = tm_get_api(reg, tm_the_truth_api);
}
</code></pre>
<p>After this, we define our type name once as a constant char define and one hashed version. There are some conventions to keep in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>The plain text define should start with: <code>TM_TT_TYPE__</code>.</li>
<li>The hashed define should start with: <code>TM_TT_TYPE_HASH__</code></li>
<li>The name may or may not start with <code>tm_</code> but the name plain text and the hashed version need to match!</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-c">#pragma once
#include &lt;foundation/api_types.h&gt;

#define TM_TT_TYPE__MY_TYPE &quot;tm_my_type&quot;
#define TM_TT_TYPE_HASH__MY_TYPE TM_STATIC_HASH(&quot;tm_my_type&quot;, 0xde0e763ccd72b89aULL)
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Do not forget to run <code>hash.exe.</code> Otherwise, the <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/api_types.h.html#tm_static_hash()"><code>TM_STATIC_HASH</code></a> macro will cause an error. You can also run <code>tmbuild --gen-hash</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is good practice to place the types into a header file so others can use these types as well!  When that is done we can call the <code>tm_the_truth_api-&gt;create_object_type()</code> to create the actual type. It will return a <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/api_types.h.html#structtm_tt_type_t"><code>tm_tt_type_t</code></a> which is the identifier of our type. The <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/api_types.h.html#structtm_tt_id_t"><code>tm_tt_id_t</code></a> will also refer to the type here! </p>
<p>The function expects:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Argument</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><code>tm_the_truth_o *tt</code></td><td>The Truth instance. This function will add the type to this instance</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>const char *name</code></td><td>The name of the type. It will be hashed internally. Therefore the hash value of <code>TM_TT_TYPE__</code>  and <code>TM_TT_TYPE_HASH___</code> should match!  <em>If a type with <code>name</code> already exists, that type is returned. Different types with the same <code>name</code> are not supported!</em></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>const tm_the_truth_property_definition_t *properties</code></td><td>The definitions of the properties of the type.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code> uint32_t num_properties</code></td><td>The number of properties. Should match <code>properties</code></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The home of this function should be our <code>void create_truth_types(tm_the_truth_o *tt)</code> . We need to add this one to our source file. After this we add the call to <code>create_object_type</code> to it. Remember that we have no properties yet, and our call would look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">static void create_truth_types(tm_the_truth_o *tt) {
  tm_the_truth_api-&gt;create_object_type(tt, TM_TT_TYPE__MY_TYPE, 0, 0);
}
</code></pre>
<p>The last step is to tell the plugin system that we intend to register our <code>register_truth_type()</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">TM_DLL_EXPORT void tm_load_plugin(struct tm_api_registry_api *reg, bool load) {
  tm_the_truth_api = tm_get_api(reg, tm_the_truth_api);
  tm_add_or_remove_implementation(reg, load, tm_the_truth_create_types_i,
                                  create_truth_types);
}
</code></pre>
<p>The full source code should look like this:</p>
<p><code>my_type.h</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#pragma once
#include &lt;foundation/api_types.h&gt;

#define TM_TT_TYPE__MY_TYPE &quot;tm_my_type&quot;
#define TM_TT_TYPE_HASH__MY_TYPE TM_STATIC_HASH(&quot;tm_my_type&quot;, 0xde0e763ccd72b89aULL)
</code></pre>
<p>(Tip: Do not forget to run hash.exe)</p>
<p><code>my_type.c</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-c">// beginning of the source file
static struct tm_the_truth_api *tm_the_truth_api;
#include &lt;foundation/api_registry.h&gt;

static void create_truth_types(tm_the_truth_o *tt)
{
    tm_the_truth_api-&gt;create_object_type(tt, TM_TT_TYPE__MY_TYPE, 0, 0);
}
TM_DLL_EXPORT void tm_load_plugin(struct tm_api_registry_api *reg, bool load)
{
    tm_the_truth_api = tm_get_api(reg, tm_the_truth_api);
    tm_add_or_remove_implementation(reg, load, tm_the_truth_create_types_i, create_truth_types);
}
</code></pre>
<p>After all of this you have registered your type and it could be used. This type is just not really useful without properties.</p>
<h2 id="about-properties"><a class="header" href="#about-properties">About Properties</a></h2>
<p>In The Truth, an Object-Type is made of one or multiple properties. Properties can represent the basic types:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>bool</code>, <code>string</code>, <code>float</code>, <code>UINT64</code>, <code>UNIT32</code>, <code>double</code>, `<code>buffer\</code></li>
<li><code>subobject</code> - An object that lives within this property </li>
<li><code>reference</code> - A reference to another object</li>
<li><code>subobject set</code> - A Set of subobjects</li>
<li><code>reference set</code> - A Set of references.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>What is the difference between a reference and a subobject?</em></p>
<p>To see the difference, consider how <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/the_truth.h.html#structtm_the_truth_api.clone_object()">clone_object()</a> works in both cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you clone an object with references, the clone will reference the same objects as the original, i.e. they now have multiple references to them.</li>
<li>When you clone an object with subobjects, all the subobjects will be cloned too. After the clone operation, there is no link between the object's subobjects and the clone's subobjects.</li>
</ul>
<p>An arbitrary number of objects can reference the same object, but a subobject only has a single owner.</p>
<p>When you destroy an object, any references to that object become NIL references — i.e., they no longer refer to anything.</p>
<p>When you destroy an object that has subobjects, all the subobjects are destroyed with it.</p>

<h2 id="adding-properties"><a class="header" href="#adding-properties">Adding properties</a></h2>
<p>Let us add some properties to our Type! As you remember, when we created the Type, the function <code>create_object_type()</code> required a pointer to the definition of properties. You can define properties via the <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/the_truth.h.html#structtm_the_truth_property_definition_t"><code>tm_the_truth_property_definition_t</code></a> struct.</p>

<p>Within our <code>create_truth_types</code> we create an array of type <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/the_truth.h.html#structtm_the_truth_property_definition_t"><code>tm_the_truth_property_definition_t</code></a>. For this example, we define the properties of type bool and string.</p>

<p>That is all we need to do to define properties for our Type! Also thanks to our automatic &quot;reflection&quot; system you do not have to worry about providing a UI for the type. The Properties View will automatically provide a UI for this type.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="creation-graphs"><a class="header" href="#creation-graphs">Creation Graphs</a></h1>
<p>The creation graph is (as the name implies) a graph based tool for creating assets. It allows developers to define and alter various types of assets using visual scripting. More broadly speaking, the creation graph can be used for arbitrary data processing tasks.</p>
<p>A creation graph thus defines the asset’s pipeline into its final state. For instance, an image asset will have a file that defines the data of the image, but the creation graph asset specifies how that data should be processed. Should it generate mipmaps, should it be compressed, do we need a CPU copy of it, etc.</p>
<p>A more familiar example might be a material shader. In The Machinery this is also defined using a creation graph. This case maps very well to Unity’s shader assets and Unreal’s material assets. In the image below you can see a simple default material with a saturated red base color.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/w5ty4r8tttntt0t/tm_guide_creation_graph_simple_material.png?dl=1" alt="Simple red material" /></p>
<p>Image loading and material creation are just a few examples of what can be achieved with the creation graph. The table below shows when a creation graph is used compared to the tools one could use in Unity and Unreal.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Asset Type</th><th>Unity</th><th>Unreal</th><th>The Machinery</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Images</td><td>Texture</td><td>Texture</td><td>Creation graphs</td></tr>
<tr><td>Materials</td><td>Shader</td><td>Material</td><td>Creation graphs</td></tr>
<tr><td>Particles</td><td>Particle Effect</td><td>Cascade</td><td>Creation graphs</td></tr>
<tr><td>Post processing</td><td>Shader</td><td>Material</td><td>Creation graphs</td></tr>
<tr><td>Procedural materials</td><td>Procedural Materials</td><td>Material</td><td>Creation graphs</td></tr>
<tr><td>Meshes</td><td>Mesh</td><td>Static Mesh</td><td>DCC Asset + <br>Creation graphs</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Another example for the creation graph is mesh processing. A graph like this will define how the mesh should be draw or traced against. The graph below takes two inputs, a material creation graph and the mesh data from a DCC asset. This data is than imported and passed to the various outputs of our mesh pipeline. In this case those are: a ray tracing instance, a normal draw call, a bounding volume, and a physics shape. Note that not all of these outputs have to be used, rather the code that uses this creation graph might only look for the rendering outputs and ignore the physics shape, whilst some other code might only care about the physics shape output.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/103bvtqaz6lnsog/tm_guide_creation_graph_mesh_processing.png?dl=1" alt="Mesh processing" /></p>
<p>Like the entity graph, the creation graph can executes nodes in sequence from an event. Some examples of this are the <code>Tick</code>, <code>Init</code>, and <code>Compile</code> events which are executed at known intervals. Most of the creation graphs however work with a reverse flow, compiling the graph into a sequence of nodes for a specific output. The two examples presented earlier show this workflow. Some outputs are: <code>Draw Call</code>, <code>Shader Instance</code>, <code>Image</code>, and <code>Physics Shape</code>. Note that these outputs are just blobs of data, an implementation can define more output type in code.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="creation-graphs-for-unity-developers"><a class="header" href="#creation-graphs-for-unity-developers">Creation Graphs for Unity Developers</a></h1>
<p>Creation graphs are used for many different assets in The Machinery. When a creation graph is used for a surface shader it most closely relates to Unity’s shader graph. This is what we will focus on first.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/lg5dir5rxbz8c6l/tm_guide_creation_graph_unity.png?dl=1" alt="Simple surface shader" /></p>
<p>In the example above the editor’s layout was made to resemble Unity’s shader graph view. When creating a material shader you need to specify a <code>Shader Instance</code> output node. From here we can specify out surface shader, in the example above the <code>Lit</code> node closely resembles Unity’s <code>PBR Master</code> node.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="creation-graphs-for-unreal-engine-developers"><a class="header" href="#creation-graphs-for-unreal-engine-developers">Creation Graphs for Unreal Engine developers</a></h1>
<p>Creation graphs are used for many different assets in The Machinery. When a creation graph is used for a shader it most closely relates to Unreal’s materials (any domain). This is what we will focus on first.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/nxy6jtq7f5drmin/tm_guide_creation_graph_unreal_material.png?dl=1" alt="Simple brick material" /></p>
<p>In the example above the editor closely resembles the material editor from Unreal, this is however not the default layout. You can see the creation graph in the center with its output being a <code>Shader Instance</code>. Adding this allows any consuming code to query the material from this creation graph and it will allow the preview tab to display your material. </p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/kpf05fwzl47d0ip/tm_guide_creation_graph_unreal_particle.png?dl=1" alt="Simple rotating particle" /></p>
<p>The previous example showed a surface or material shader. This example shows a creation graph that fully defines a simple particle. The <code>Shader Instance</code> (material) is now passed to a <code>Draw Call</code> node, with this combination we can now fully render the particle without the need of an explicit mesh. Instead we use the <code>Construct Quad</code> node for a procedural quad mesh. Note that we specify the <code>Instance Count</code> and <code>Num Vertices</code> (for a single quad that is 6).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="node-types"><a class="header" href="#node-types">Node types</a></h1>
<p>Nodes in the creation graph can be subdivided into four types, understanding the difference between these nodes is important when creating new nodes. The diagram below shows how each node can be categorized.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/h4uni5g7syk0zgn/tm_guide_creation_graph_node_types_graph.png?dl=1" alt="" /></p>
<p>GPU nodes are somewhat special as they will be compiled down into a single shader instead of being interpreted like the CPU part of the creation graph. Note that GPU nodes also have a different background color to distinguish them. GPU nodes will not connect to any CPU node unless their output is a <code>Shader Instance</code>, this is the point where the GPU portion of the graph is compiled and passed to the CPU.</p>
<p>The CPU portion of a creation graph is very similar to the entity graph in terms of layout with one exception. The creation graph often works by querying <code>output nodes</code> from the creation graph and working its way back from there. <code>event nodes</code> on the other hand allow you to follow the same flow as the entity graph, beginning from some event and continuing into other nodes. </p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/poi2rg73gttdixz/tm_guide_creation_graph_node_types_practical.png?dl=1" alt="" /></p>
<p>In the example above you can see a creation graph that could be passed to a <code>render component</code> because it uses the <code>Draw Call</code> and <code>Bounding Volume</code> output nodes. The parameters to these are: a DCC mesh and a <code>Lit Shader Instance</code>. Note the <code>Variable</code> GPU node that is used to pass the color from the CPU side to the GPU side, this is the only way to connect CPU nodes to GPU nodes.
Currently we support the following output nodes, note that multiple of these can be present in a single creation graph.</p>

<tr><td>Image Output</td><td>Allows preview, creates asset thumbnail.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Bounding Volume</td><td>Used for culling.</td></tr>

<p>A creation graph interacts with the shader system in three main ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its GPU nodes are defined using <code>.tmsl</code> shaders.</li>
<li>GPU output nodes call special linker functions to evaluate the creation graph.</li>
<li>Shader instances in a creation graph are constructed using the shader system.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last point is a technical detail that doesn’t matter for anyone extending or using the creation graph so it won’t be covered in this guide. Additional information about the <code>creation_graph_node</code> shader block can be found in the <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/doc/shader_system_reference.md.html">Shader System Reference</a>.</p>
<p>Any GPU node that can be used in the creation graph has an associated <code>.tmsl</code> shader file. Most of these can be found here: <code>the_machinery/shaders/nodes/*.tmsl</code>. We also supply a <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=OurMachinery.tmShaderLang">Visual Studio extension</a> for this file format which adds syntax highlighting, this extension will be used in this guide. </p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/4o13cq3rzvqm813/tm_guide_creation_graph_sin_node.png?dl=1" alt="" /></p>
<p>This is the shader code for the <code>Sin</code> node. It defines one input (<code>a</code>) and one output (<code>res</code>, which is the same type as <code>a</code>). This shader file will be constructed using the shader system into a single <code>.hlsl</code> function. For more information on how to create basic GPU nodes see <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/tutorials/creation_graph/custom_gpu_nodes.html">Creating custom GPU Nodes</a>.</p>

<p>This is an example of the shader code needed in the creation graph output nodes. When a creation graph node outputs a <code>Shader Instance</code> and has any inputs; it should define these three functions in it’s shader code block so the graph can be evaluated. The <code>tm_graph_read</code> function passes all the stage input variables to the graph (like position, color, uv, etc.). The <code>tm_graph_evaluate</code> function does most of the work. It uses the <code>tm_graph_io_t</code> struct to evaluate the graph by calling the functions generated by the normal nodes. Finally the <code>tm_graph_write</code> function passes all the graph variable to the stage output. It is important to note that whilst the <code>tm_graph_evaluate</code> function is necessary for graph evaluation; the <code>tm_graph_read</code> and <code>tm_graph_write</code> are not, they are helper function.

<p>In The Machinery a <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/plugins/entity/camera_component.h.html">camera</a> is an object that converts the simulated world into a two-dimensional image. It can do this with in a physically plausible way or in a more arcade way depending on how it is set up. The method chosen is called the projection mode and The Machinery offers three modes: Perspective, Orthographic, and Physical.</p>
<h2 id="adding-a-camera-to-the-scene"><a class="header" href="#adding-a-camera-to-the-scene">Adding a camera to the scene</a></h2>
<p>A camera must be used to view any scene, the <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book/the_editor/scene_tab.html">Scene Tab</a> therefor starts with a default camera. But once you wish to simulate this world an additional camera is needed. This can be done by adding a Camera Component to any entity in the scene and setting it as the viewing camera using the Set Camera node.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/7cwc768hu7ltll4/tm_guide_camera_tree_tab.png?dl=1" alt="" /></p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/foeulmeuaef5c2j/tm_guide_camera_graph.png?dl=1" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="customizing-the-camera"><a class="header" href="#customizing-the-camera">Customizing the camera</a></h2>
<p>The first thing to consider when adding a camera to a scene is which projection mode it should use.<br />
<strong>Perspective</strong> is the default projection mode. This projection mode linearly projects three-dimensional objects into two-dimensions, this was the effect that objects further away from the camera appear smaller than objects near the camera. This camera is controlled by changed the Vertical Field of View property.<br />
<strong>Physical</strong> cameras use the same projection as perspective cameras, but instead of controlling the camera using FoV, this camera is controlled using focal length. This camera is intended for users familiar with real world cameras and aims to be more physically descriptive than its protective counterpart.<br />
<strong>Orthographic</strong> cameras use parallel projection instead of linear projection. This means that depth has no impact on the objects scale. These cameras are often useful when making a 2D or isometric game. This camera is controlled using the box height property.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/qpk260eul8fms22/tm_guide_camera_orthographic.png?dl=1" alt="Orthographic camera" /></p>
<p>Additionally all projection modes define near and far plane properties. These directly correlate to the visible range of the camera. Lowering the visible range can improve precision within that range which might reduce depth artifacts. But this can also be used to create impossible shots, like being able to view through walls.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/8l33j979p9spfty/tm_guide_camera_near_clipping.png?dl=1" alt="Setting the near plane to 4 allows us to place the camera outside of the room whilst still being able to view into it." /></p>

<tr><td>Aperture</td><td>Specifies the aperture ratio of the lens. This is expressed as an f-number or f-stop. Smaller f-numbers relate to larger diaphragm openings in the lens which allow more light onto the sensor. This brightens the image, but also lowers the depth of field.

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="physically-based-light-and-cameras"><a class="header" href="#physically-based-light-and-cameras">Physically based light and cameras</a></h1>
<p>The Machinery’s default render pipeline uses exclusively physically based rendering for accurate and predictable results based on real-life measurements. Using physically based units to set light intensity and camera parameters are therefor paramount to synthesizing accurate images. These units are widely used in the real-world, like on light bulb packaging, DSLR-cameras, and light meters.</p>
<h2 id="basics-of-physical-light"><a class="header" href="#basics-of-physical-light">Basics of physical light</a></h2>
<p>For the purposes of real-time rendering we can split up light into two parts: the luminous flux and the chromaticity. Here the luminous flux is the strength of power of the light source, i.e. the more luminous flux the brighter the light. The chromaticity on the other hand is the color of the light regardless of its luminance. </p>
<p>Note that when we talk about luminous flux we are referring to the total amount light emitted from the source, not the light received by an object. In this case we would refer to illuminance, which is the total amount of light falling on a given surface. This distinction is important as The Machinery allows the user to specify their light intensity in both luminance and illuminance, where illuminance assumes a unit area (1 m^2) for the light to fall on.</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Illuminance_Diagram.tif/lossy-page1-1280px-Illuminance_Diagram.tif.jpg" alt="By Jrh.main - Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=69452076" /></p>
<p>The Machinery supports a wide range of light units. It is up to the user to determine which light unit they wish to use. The available units are:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th><strong>Unit</strong></th><th><strong>Type</strong></th><th><strong>Short Description</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Candela (cd)</td><td>Luminous Intensity</td><td>Scientific measurement of light being emitted in a certain direction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Lumen (lm)</td><td>Luminous Flux</td><td>Total amount of light emitted from a source. This is easiest to reference with real-world artificial lights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Lux (lx)</td><td>Illuminance</td><td>Amount of light hitting one square meter. Most useful for directional lights.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Nits</td><td>Luminance</td><td>Total light intensity of an area light. Easy to reference with real-world monitors and TVs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Exposure Value (EV)</td><td>Camera</td><td>Units relative to the viewing camera. Easiest unit to use if you’re not familiar with physically based units.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<h3 id="candela-cd"><a class="header" href="#candela-cd">Candela (cd)</a></h3>
<p>Candela is the SI base unit of luminous intensity (not to be confused with luminous flux). It measures the amount of light emitted in a particular direction as perceived by the human eye. Candela is mainly useful when accurate measurements relative to the human eye are required. A common wax candle emits light with a luminous intensity of roughly one candela. Because of its scientific nature; we only allow the use of candela for punctual light sources (point and spot lights) as they have a well defined area of effect.</p>
<h3 id="lumen-lm"><a class="header" href="#lumen-lm">Lumen (lm)</a></h3>
<p>Lumen is the SI unit used to measure luminous flux. This measures the total amount of light emitted by a light source relative to the human eye. Lumens are useful units when describing artificial light sources like lamps. Therefor they are available for punctual light sources (point and spot lights) and area lights. The amount of lumen produced by an artificial light source can often be found on the light bulb’s box. For instance a decorative light might emit about 30 lm, whilst a interior light might emit 1000 lm.</p>
<h3 id="lux-lx"><a class="header" href="#lux-lx">Lux (lx)</a></h3>
<p>Lux is an SI derived unit for illuminance and is equal to one lumen per square meter. The Machinery uses a scaled version of lux as its main light unit when rendering, meaning this unit is almost directly mapped to the rendering pipeline. Lux is particularly useful when describing a light source that doesn’t have a well defined source (like directional or IBL lights). Lux can be measured by devices available to the consumer. For reference, a starlit night might produce 0.001 lx, whilst a overcast day might produce around 1000 lx. </p>
<h3 id="nits-cdm2"><a class="header" href="#nits-cdm2">Nits (cd/m^2)</a></h3>
<p>The Nit is an SI derived unit for luminance and is equal to one candela per square meter. It describes how much light in emitted from a particular area and is therefor only available for area lights as they have a well defined area. Nits are particularly useful when modeling a virtual display as most displays specify their brightness on the box using Nits. For example, the sRGB specification targets monitors at 80 Nits, most LCD consumer monitors are around 300 Nits, and HDR monitors can range from 450 to 1600 Nits.</p>
<h3 id="exposure-value-ev"><a class="header" href="#exposure-value-ev">Exposure Value (EV)</a></h3>
<p>Exposure Value is a derived unit for illuminance relative to a camera at ISO level 100. Although not a unit of light, exposure value is a very useful unit as it describes light intensity in a more human readable way. For example 1 EV is about a moonlit night, whilst 10 EV is an overcast scene. Exposure value is available for all light sources as it describes intensity as perceived by a camera.</p>
<h3 id="chromaticity"><a class="header" href="#chromaticity">Chromaticity</a></h3>
<p>Light color can be described using various specifications in The Machinery. The most artist friendly ways of specifying light color being RGB and HSV. Both of these methods employ a trichromacy model to describe color which is assumed by most models in color science. Another way to specify color is using color temperature with Kelvin. This is often used in the real world for light bulbs to indicate which hue is emitted by them, ranging from a dark orange to a light blue. For example 1850 K specified the hue emitted by a wax candle, whilst 3000 K is often closer to LED's. </p>
<h2 id="basics-of-physical-cameras"><a class="header" href="#basics-of-physical-cameras">Basics of physical cameras</a></h2>
<p>The use of physically based light can create a scene which has greater accuracy than a scene without regards for physical correctness, however any scene in inevitably viewed through a camera. Using the physical camera with post processing effects based on that camera greatly increases the accuracy of the synthesized scene. Note that this is not always desired as it comes as the cost of artist flexibility and requires the user to be familiar with real-world cameras. This section will focus on the physical camera, for more information about camera in general see [Camera].</p>
<p>Real-world camera setups can be roughly divided into two parts, the camera itself and the lens. If a first-person view is desired than the brain can be though of as the camera, whilst the eye will function as the lens. Here the camera is the object that transforms the visible scene into an image whilst the lens modifies the view that the camera has into the scene.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.rags-int-inc.com/phototechstuff/lens101/LensDiagram_1024.gif" alt="http://www.rags-int-inc.com/phototechstuff/lens101/LensDiagram_1024.gif" /></p>
<p>The diagram above shows a simplified diagram of how a real-world camera projects the scene onto the sensor. In The Machinery we don’t simulate all aspects of a real-world camera, as that would be too expensive for games. Instead we use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_lens">thin lens</a> model or a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinhole_camera">pinhole camera</a> based on the desired post-processing effects. This means that the physical camera has the following properties which should be familiar to anyone who has worked in the field of photography.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th><strong>Property</strong></th><th><strong>Short Description</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Focal Length</td><td>The distance in millimeters from the center of the lens to the focal plane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Shutter Speed</td><td>The amount of seconds that the shutter allows light onto the sensor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Aperture</td><td>The aperture size in f-stops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>ISO</td><td>The sensors sensitivity, 100 is the native sensitivity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sensor Size</td><td>The physical size of the sensor in millimeters.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Focus Distance</td><td>The distance in meters from the focal plane to the object in perfect focus.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<h3 id="focal-length"><a class="header" href="#focal-length">Focal Length</a></h3>
<p>The focal length the lens specified how strongly the lens converges or diverges the incoming light. This is mainly determined by the curvature of the lens. i.e. the thicker the lens the shorter the focal length. This is also the main driver behind the field of view of the camera. A long focal length (i.e. a thin lens) creates a narrow field of view, whilst a short focal length (i.e. a thick lens) creates a wide field of view. When zooming in on a physical camera you would increase the focal length of the camera by physically moving one or more lens elements forwards in the lens. Conversely, to zoom out you would decrease the distance between one or more lens elements and the image sensor.</p>
<h3 id="shutter-speed"><a class="header" href="#shutter-speed">Shutter Speed</a></h3>
<p>The shutter speed of the camera determines how long light is allowed to fall onto the camera sensor. The more light is allowed onto the sensor the brighter the image, which might be required in dark scenes. But, this introduces motion blur as subjects move whilst the frame is being taken. conversely in bright scenes the shutter speed could be very short which makes motion blur less noticeable. In The Machinery motion blur is an (not yet implemented) optional post-processing effect, and increasing the shutter speed doesn’t actually change the time it takes to take a frame.</p>
<h3 id="aperture"><a class="header" href="#aperture">Aperture</a></h3>
<p>The aperture of a lens describes the size of the opening that allows light to pass onto the sensor. Just like with shutter speed, the more light is allowed onto the sensor the brighter the image. But, when the aperture is opened it lowers the depth of field. The aperture of the lens isn’t actually specified as a physical size, instead a ratio is used between the focal length of the lens and the diameter opening, this ratio is often referred to as f-stops or f-numbers. Perhaps unintuitively, as the f-number decreases the lens diaphragm opens increasing the lens opening.</p>
<h3 id="iso"><a class="header" href="#iso">ISO</a></h3>
<p>The ISO of the camera specifies the sensitivity of the camera sensor to light. A more sensitive sensor captures more light which brightens the image, but this introduces noise and film grain on the final frame. Note that film grain is an (not yet implemented) optional post-processing effect.</p>
<h3 id="sensor-size"><a class="header" href="#sensor-size">Sensor Size</a></h3>
<p>The width and height of the sensor in millimeters. This is the second driver behind the final field of view of the camera. The size of the sensor should also impact the aspect ratio of the final frame, but this is not yet implemented. Typically the sensor size would be set to a constant value and a fitting algorithm would determine how the image is displayed on the users screen. For example, by stretching or cropping the image.</p>
<h3 id="focus-distance"><a class="header" href="#focus-distance">Focus Distance</a></h3>
<p>The focus distance of the camera determines at which distance the an objects needs to be from the camera to be in perfect focus. This parameter is only used when the depth-of-field post-processing effect is active. The focus distance is proportional to the focal length and the image distance.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="creation-graphs-1"><a class="header" href="#creation-graphs-1">Creation Graphs</a></h1>
<p>The creation graph is (as the name implies) a graph based tool for creating assets. It allows developers to define and alter various types of assets using visual scripting. More broadly speaking, the creation graph can be used for arbitrary data processing tasks.</p>
<p>A creation graph thus defines the asset’s pipeline into its final state. For instance, an image asset will have a file that defines the data of the image, but the creation graph asset specifies how that data should be processed. Should it generate mipmaps, should it be compressed, do we need a CPU copy of it, etc.</p>
<p>A more familiar example might be a material shader. In The Machinery this is also defined using a creation graph. This case maps very well to Unity’s shader assets and Unreal’s material assets. In the image below you can see a simple default material with a saturated red base color.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/w5ty4r8tttntt0t/tm_guide_creation_graph_simple_material.png?dl=1" alt="Simple red material" /></p>
<p>Image loading and material creation are just a few examples of what can be achieved with the creation graph. The table below shows when a creation graph is used compared to the tools one could use in Unity and Unreal.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Asset Type</th><th>Unity</th><th>Unreal</th><th>The Machinery</th></tr></thead><tbody>

<tr><td>Procedural materials</td><td>Procedural Materials</td><td>Material</td><td>Creation graphs</td></tr>
<tr><td>Meshes</td><td>Mesh</td><td>Static Mesh</td><td>DCC Asset + <br>Creation graphs</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Another example for the creation graph is mesh processing. A graph like this will define how the mesh should be draw or traced against. The graph below takes two inputs, a material creation graph and the mesh data from a DCC asset. This data is than imported and passed to the various outputs of our mesh pipeline. In this case those are: a ray tracing instance, a normal draw call, a bounding volume, and a physics shape. Note that not all of these outputs have to be used, rather the code that uses this creation graph might only look for the rendering outputs and ignore the physics shape, whilst some other code might only care about the physics shape output.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/103bvtqaz6lnsog/tm_guide_creation_graph_mesh_processing.png?dl=1" alt="Mesh processing" /></p>
<p>Like the entity graph, the creation graph can executes nodes in sequence from an event. Some examples of this are the <code>Tick</code>, <code>Init</code>, and <code>Compile</code> events which are executed at known intervals. Most of the creation graphs however work with a reverse flow, compiling the graph into a sequence of nodes for a specific output. The two examples presented earlier show this workflow. Some outputs are: <code>Draw Call</code>, <code>Shader Instance</code>, <code>Image</code>, and <code>Physics Shape</code>. Note that these outputs are just blobs of data, an implementation can define more output type in code.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="shaders"><a class="header" href="#shaders">Shaders</a></h1>
<p>The Creation Graph provides an artist-friendly way to create custom shaders by wiring together nodes into a shader network. Each node in the graph represents a snippet of HLSL code that gets combined by the shader system plugin into full HLSL programs. It can sometimes be nice to work directly with HLSL code for more advanced shaders, either by exposing new helper nodes to the Creation Graph or by directly writing a complete shader program in HLSL. This is typically done by adding new <code>.tmsl</code> files (where <code>tmsl</code> stands for <code>The Machinery Shading Language</code>) that The Machinery loads on boot up.</p>
<p>A <code>.tmsl</code> file is essentially a data-driven JSON front-end for creating and populating a <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/plugins/shader_system/shader_system.h.html#tm_shader_declaration_o"><code>tm_shader_declaration_o</code></a> structure which is the main building block that the compiler in shader system plugin operates on. While a <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/plugins/shader_system/shader_system.h.html#tm_shader_declaration_o"><code>tm_shader_declaration_o</code></a> can contain anything needed to compile a complete shader (all needed shader stages, any states and input/output it needs, etc), it is more common that they contain only fragments of and multiple <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/plugins/shader_system/shader_system.h.html#tm_shader_declaration_o"><code>tm_shader_declaration_o</code></a> are combined into the final shader source that gets compiled into a <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/plugins/shader_system/shader_system.h.html#tm_shader_o"><code>tm_shader_o</code></a> that can be used when rendering a draw call (or dispatching a compute job).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can find all built-in shaders in the folder: <code>./bin/data/shaders</code> shipped with your engine version. (For source access: <code>./the_machinery/shaders</code>)</p>

<p>Inserting the <code>creation_graph</code> block in the <code>.tmsl</code> file will get exposed as a node in the Creation Graph. Nodes exposed to the Creation Graph can either be <em>function</em> nodes (see: <code>data/shaders/nodes/</code>) or <em>output</em> nodes (see: <code>data/shaders/output_nodes/</code>). A <em>function</em> node won't compile into anything by itself unless it's connected to an <em>output</em> node responsible for declaring the actual shader stages and evaluating the branches of connected <em>function</em> nodes.</p>

<p>Typically these are function nodes (see <code>data/shaders/nodes</code>) that won't compile into anything without getting connected to an &quot;output&quot; node. We ship with a few built-in output nodes (see <code>data/shaders/output_nodes</code>) responsible for declaring the actual shader stages and glue everything together. </p>

<p>If you intend to write custom shaders you can. All your custom shaders need to be placed under the <code>bin\data\shaders</code> of the engine. They will be automatically compiled (if needed) on boot up of the Editor.

<p>Shaders in The Machinery are defined using The Machinery Shader Language (<code>tmsl</code>). Traditionally shaders (like those written in <code>glsl</code> or <code>hlsl</code>) only contain the shader code itself and some I/O definitions. The Machinery (like other engines) stores not only the shader code, but also the pipeline state in its shader files. Additionally The Machinery allows shaders to define variations and systems that allow for more complex shader generation and combinations. For a complete list of what can be in a <code>tmsl</code> file see the <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/doc/shader_system_reference.md.html">Shader System Reference</a>. For an in depth look at the design goals of these shader files see <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/post/the-machinery-shader-system-part-1/">The Machinery Shader System</a> blog posts.</p>
<p>A shader file can be divided into three distinct sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code blocks, these define <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3dhlsl/dx-graphics-hlsl">HLSL</a> code blocks that contain the main shader code.</li>
<li>Pipeline state blocks, these define the Pipeline State Objects (PSO) or shader environment required for the code to run. </li>
<li>Compilation blocks, these define meta information about how the shader should be compiled. This also allows for multiple variations of shaders, for instance one with multi-sampling enabled and one with multi-sampling disabled.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s have a look at a <code>Hello Triangle</code> shader for The Machinery.</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">imports: [
    { name: &quot;color&quot; type: &quot;float3&quot; }
]

vertex_shader: {
    import_system_semantics : [ &quot;vertex_id&quot; ]

    code: [[
        const float2 vertices[] = {
            float2(-0.7f, 0.7f),
            float2(0.7f, 0.7f),
            float2(0.0f, -0.7f)
        };

        output.position = float4(vertices[vertex_id], 0.0f, 1.0f);
        return output;
    ]]
}

pixel_shader: {
    code: [[
        output.color = load_color();
        return output;
    ]]
}

compile: {}
</code></pre>
<p>In this example we have some shader code, no explicit pipeline state, and an empty compile block. The first thing to note is that <code>tmsl</code>  files use a JSON like format. The main sections of code are the <code>vertex_shader</code> and the <code>pixel_shader</code> blocks. Within these are <code>code</code> blocks which specify the HLSL code that needs to run at the relative pipeline stage. In this example we create a screen-space triangle from three constant vertices and give it a color passed on as an input.</p>
<p>If we want to pass anything to a shader we need to define it in the <code>imports</code> block. Anything defined in here will be accessible though <code>load_#</code> or <code>get_#</code> functions. See the <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/doc/shader_system_reference.md.html">Shader System Reference</a> for more information.</p>
<p>We also need to define a <code>compile</code> or <code>system</code> block in order for our shader to be compiled. If neither block is defined then the shader is assumed to be a library type shader which can be included into other shaders. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can find all built-in shaders in the folder: <code>./bin/data/shaders/</code> in the shipped engine (for source code access this is: <code>./the_machinery/shaders/</code>).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="procedural-shaders"><a class="header" href="#procedural-shaders">Procedural shaders</a></h2>
<p>Note that shaders don’t have to be written and compiled in this way. You can generate shaders directly from code using the <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/plugins/shader_system/shader_system.h.html#structtm_shader_repository_api"><code>tm_shader_repository_api</code></a>. You can create a new shader declaration by calling <code>create_shader_declaration()</code>, populate it with your custom code by using the <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/plugins/shader_system/shader_system.h.html#structtm_shader_declaration_api"><code>tm_shader_declaration_api</code></a>, and compile it using <code>create_from_declaration()</code>. Any <code>tmsl</code> file will go through the same pipeline. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Shader are also used to create GPU nodes for the Creation Graph, see Creation Graph: <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book//creation_graphs/shader_system.html">Shader System Interaction</a> for more information.</p>

<p>In The Machinery, <strong>everything is a <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book/extending_the_machinery/the_plugin_system.html">plugin</a></strong>. You can <strong>extend</strong>, <strong>modify</strong> or <strong>replace</strong> existing engine functionality with your plugins. </p>
<p>The Engine explicitly aims to be simple, minimalistic, and easy to understand. All our code is written in plain C, a significantly more straightforward language than modern C++. The entire codebase compiles in less than 30 seconds, and we support hot-reloading of DLLs, allowing for fast iteration cycles. You can modify your plugin code while the editor or the game runs since the plugin system supports <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book/extending_the_machinery/hot-reloading.html">hot-reloading</a>. In short, we want to be &quot;hackable.&quot; Our APIs are exposed as C interfaces, which means you can easily use them from C, C++, D, or any other language with an FFI for calling into C code.</p>

<p><em>The Machinery</em> is built around a plugin model. All features, even the built-in ones, are provided through plugins. You can extend <em>The Machinery</em> by writing your own plugins.</p>
<p>When <em>The Machinery</em> launches, it loads all the plugins named <code>tm_*.dll</code> in its <code>plugins/</code> folder. If you write your own plugins, name them so that they start with <code>tm_</code> and put them in this folder, they will be loaded together with the built-in plugins.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When you create a new plugin via the Engine, the <code>premake</code> file will <strong>not</strong> copy the plugin into your global plugin folder. The reason behind this is that we do not know if you want to create a plugin asset.</p>

<p>In <em>The Machinery</em> you can have 2 type of plugins: <em>Engine Plugins</em> and <em>Plugin Assets</em>.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th></th><th>Engine Plugins</th><th>Plugin Assets</th></tr></thead><tbody>

<h2 id="what-are-plugins"><a class="header" href="#what-are-plugins">What are plugins?</a></h2>
<p>In The Machinery is a Shared Library (<code>.dll</code> or <code>.so</code>) that contains the plugin entry function <code>TM_DLL_EXPORT void tm_load_plugin(struct tm_api_registry_api *reg, bool load)</code> . This is the only function that needs to be there. Otherwise the Engine could not load your plugin. Every plugin is a collection of <strong>API's</strong> or <strong>Interfaces</strong>. They together form a plugin and give the Engine the Extensibility and flexibility.</p>
<h2 id="about-apis"><a class="header" href="#about-apis">About API's</a></h2>
<p><em>The Machinery</em> is organized into individual APIs that can be called to perform specific tasks. A
plugin is a DLL that exposes one or several of these APIs. In order to implement its functionality,
the plugin may in turn rely on APIs exposed by other plugins.</p>
<p>A central object called the <em>API registry</em> is used to keep track of all the APIs. When you want to
use an API from another plugin, you ask the API registry for it. Similarly, you expose your APIs to
the world by registering them with the API registry.</p>
<p>This may seem a bit abstract at this point, so let’s look at a concrete example, <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/unicode.h.html#unicode.h"><code>unicode.h</code></a> which
exposes an API for encoding and decoding Unicode strings:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">{{$include {TM_SDK_DIR}/foundation/unicode.h:0:97}}
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s go through this.</p>
<p>First, the code includes <code>&lt;api_types.h&gt;</code>. This is a shared header with common type declarations, it
includes things like <code>&lt;stdbool.h&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;stdint.h&gt;</code> and also defines a few <em>The Machinery</em> specific
types, such as <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/api_types.h.html#structtm_vec3_t"><code>tm_vec3_t</code></a>.</p>
<p>In <em>The Machinery</em> we have a rule that header files can't include other header files (except
for <code>&lt;api_types.h&gt;</code>). This helps keep compile times down, but it also simplifies the structure of the
code. When you read a header file you don’t have to follow a long chain of other header files to understand
what is happening.</p>
<p>Next follows a block of forward struct declarations (in this case only one).</p>
<p>Next, we have the name of this API defined as a constant <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/unicode.h.html#structtm_unicode_api"><code>tm_unicode_api</code></a>, followed by the
<code>struct tm_unicode_api</code> that defines the functions in the API.</p>
<p>To use this API, you would first use the API registry to query for the API pointer, then using that
pointer, call the functions of the API:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">static struct tm_unicode_api *tm_unicode_api;
#include &lt;foundation/api_registry.h&gt;
#include &lt;foundation/unicode.h&gt;

static void demo_usage(char *utf8, uint32_t codepoint)
{
    tm_unicode_api-&gt;utf8_encode(utf8, codepoint);
    //more code...
}

TM_DLL_EXPORT void tm_load_plugin(struct tm_api_registry_api *reg, bool load)
{
    tm_unicode_api = tm_get_api(reg, tm_unicode_api);
}
</code></pre>
<p>The different APIs that you can query for and use are documented in their respective header files,
and in the <code>apidoc.md.html</code> documentation file (which is just extracted from the headers). Consult
these files for information on how to use the various APIs that are available in <em>The Machinery.</em></p>
<p>In addition to APIs defined in header files, <em>The Machinery</em> also contains some header files with
inline functions that you can include directly into your implementation files. For example
<code>&lt;math.inl&gt;</code> provides common mathematical operations on vectors and matrices, while <code>&lt;carray.inl&gt;</code>
provides a “stretchy-buffer” implementation (i.e. a C version of C++’s <code>std::vector</code>).</p>
<h2 id="about-interfaces"><a class="header" href="#about-interfaces">About Interfaces</a></h2>
<p>We also add an <em>implementation</em> of the unit test <em>interface</em> to the registry. The API registry has
support for both APIs and interfaces. The difference is that APIs only have a single implementation,
whereas interfaces can have many implementations. For example, all code that can be unit-tested
implements the unit test interface. Unit test programs can query the API registry to find all these
implementations and run all the unit tests.</p>
<p>To extend the editor you add implementations to the interfaces used by the editor. For example, you
can add implementations of the <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/the_truth.h.html#tm_the_truth_create_types_i"><code>tm_the_truth_create_types_i</code></a>  in order to create new
data types in The Truth, and add implementations of the <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/plugins/entity/entity.h.html#tm_entity_create_component_i"><code>tm_entity_create_component_i</code></a>
in order to define new entity components. See the sample plugin examples.</p>
<p>It does not matter in which order the plugins are loaded. If you query for a plugin that hasn’t yet
been registered, you get a pointer to a nulled struct back. When the plugin is loaded, that struct
is filled in with the actual function pointers. As long as you don’t <em>call</em> the functions before the
plugin that implements them has been loaded, you are good. (You can test this by checking for NULL
pointers in the struct.)</p>

<p><em>The Machinery</em> uses C99 as its interface language. I.e., all the header files that you use to communicate with <em>The Machinery</em> are C99 header files, and when you write a plugin, you should expose C99 headers for your APIs. The <em>implementation</em> of a plugin can be written in whichever language you like, as long as it exposes and communicates through a C99 header. In particular, you can write the implementation in C++ if you want to. (At Our Machinery, we write the implementations in C99.)</p>

<h4 id="premake5"><a class="header" href="#premake5">Premake5</a></h4>
<p>We are using <a href="https://premake.github.io/">Premake</a> for our meta-build system generator at Our Machinery. This file defines our plugin binary dependencies and builds options for all the Machinery platforms. Premake generates the actual build scripts that we then build with tmbuild, our one-click build tool. More on tmbuild <a href="https://books.ourmachinery.com/the_machinery_book/extending_the_machinery/helper_tools/tmbuild.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>We recommend you to use one single premake file that manages all your plugins. Having a main premake file avoids going into each project folder to build your project. As recommended in the chapter <a href="https://books.ourmachinery.com/the_machinery_book/extending_the_machinery/getting_started/project_setup.html#possible-folder-structure-for-a-project">Project Setup: Possible folder structure for a project</a>, we also recommend separating your plugins into subfolders. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The current plugin templates always create all metafiles directly for you, but you can just adjust the main premake file and delete the other ones. This workflow is in review.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Book Chapter <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book/extending_the_machinery/premake.html">Premake</a> you can find more in-depth information about the premake file. </p>
<h4 id="libsjson"><a class="header" href="#libsjson">Libs.json</a></h4>
<p>This file tells tmbuild what kind of binary dependencies you have and what versions you need. tmbuild will automatically download them for you. For more information on the libs.json file, read its <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book//helper_tools/libs_json_reference.md">chapter</a>.</p>
<h4 id="the-build-scripts"><a class="header" href="#the-build-scripts">The Build Scripts</a></h4>
<p>Every plugin that is generated with the engines comes with a <code>build.bat</code> or <code>build.sh</code> at the moment. They are here to help you with your workflow. Whenever you execute them for the first time (double click on them) the script will ask you if you want your plugin to be copied into the plugins folder or if you want a plugin asset. If you decide to create a plugin asset, you need to import the Shared Lib once into your project and then use the Import Change option. More infos on Plugin Asset <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book/extending_the_machinery/plugin-assets.html">here</a>.</p>
<p><em>What is the difference between a Plugin Asset and an Engine Plugin?</em></p>
<p>The significant difference is that a plugin asset is an imported Shared Library that lives within your project as a binary data blob. A plugin asset means it is only available within this project and not within other projects. On the other hand, an Engine plugin lives in the engines plugin folder and is available within all projects. More on the difference <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book//extending_the_machinery/the_plugin_system.html">here</a>.</p>
<h4 id="source-code"><a class="header" href="#source-code">Source Code</a></h4>
<p>Your actual plugin code lives within the source files within Source Files and header files that help the outside world to make use of the plugin. Every plugin has one entry point. This is the source file that contains the <code>tm_load_plugin</code> function.</p>
<h4 id="entry-point"><a class="header" href="#entry-point">Entry Point</a></h4>
<p>The <code>tm_load_plugin()</code> function is our entry point.  In this function, we get access to the API Registry. All our APIs or Interfaces are living within this API.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The difference is that APIs only have a single implementation, whereas interfaces can have many implementations. For more information: Check the <a href="https://books.ourmachinery.com/the_machinery_book/extending_the_machinery/the_plugin_system.html">Plugin System Chapter</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can register everything we need to register to the Engines Plugin System. You mustn't execute heavy code in this function or rely on other plugins since they might not be loaded yet! This function is just there to perform load and register operations.</p>
<p>It is not recommended to use this function to initialize and deinitialize data. For such things, we recommend using the <code>init</code> or <code>shutdown</code> call-back, especially since they are guaranteed to be only called when an initialization or a shutdown happens. This is in contrast to the <code>tm_load_plugin()</code> since this function is also called on reload.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<h3 id="plugin-callbacks-init-shutdown-tick"><a class="header" href="#plugin-callbacks-init-shutdown-tick">Plugin callbacks (Init, Shutdown, Tick)</a></h3>
<p>The plugin system also provides for plugin call-backs. <strong>It is recommended to rely on these calls as little as possible.</strong> You should not rely on those for your gameplay code!</p>
<p><a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/plugin_callbacks.h.html#structtm_plugin_init_i"><code>tm_plugin_init_i</code></a> - This is typically called as early as possible after all plugins have been loaded.</p>

<p>This API shall allow us to register commands in any plugin and execute them later if needed.</p>
<p>In our first API, we want to have a function that creates an API context that we need to initialize and deinitialize at the end. Moreover, we want to create an interface that we can use to register commands that you can execute via the Command API. Since requesting all commands every time might be slow, we want to cache them at the beginning of the plugin and at the end. Also, on reload.</p>

<p>When The Machinery loads a plugin DLL, it looks for the <code>tm_load_plugin()</code> function and calls it. If it can't find the function, it prints an error message. We store the API registry pointer in a static variable so that we can use it everywhere in our DLL.
We also <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/api_registry.h.html#tm_get_api()"><code>tm_get_api()</code></a> some of the API pointers that we will use frequently and store them in static variables so that we don’t have to use the registry to query for them every time we want to use them. Finally, we add our own API to the registry, so others can query for and use it.</p>

<p>The easiest way to build a plugin is to start with an existing example. There are three places where
you can find plugin samples:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The <code>samples</code> folder in the SDK has a number of plugin samples.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>All Sample Projects</em> package in the <em>Download</em> tab has a <code>plugins</code> folder with some small
samples. You can also find their source code here: <a href="https://github.com/OurMachinery/sample-projects">https://github.com/OurMachinery/sample-projects</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can create a new plugin with the menu command <strong>File &gt; New Plugin</strong>. This will create a
new <code>.c</code> file for the plugin together with some helper files for compiling it. (<a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book//extending_the_machinery/write-a-plugin.html#write-your-own-plugin">Follow this guide</a>)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The distribution already comes with pre-built .dlls for the sample plugins, such as
<code>bin/plugins/tm_pong_tab.dll</code>. You can see this plugin in action by selecting <strong>Tab &gt; Pong</strong> in the
editor to open up its tab:</p>

<p>To build plugins you need three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>You need to have Visual Studio 2019 installed including the MS C++ Build Tools on your computer.
Note that the Community Edition works fine. (Or clang and the build essentials on Linux)</li>
<li>You need to set the <code>TM_SDK_DIR</code> environment variable to the path of the SDK package that you
installed on your computer. When you compile a plugin, it looks for The Machinery headers in the
<code>%TM_SDK_DIR%/headers</code> folder. </li>
<li>You need the <code>tmbuild.exe</code> from the SDK package. <code>tmbuild.exe</code> does all the steps needed to
compile the plugin. Put it in your <code>PATH</code> or copy it to your plugin folder so that you can run it
easily from the command line.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="build-the-sample-plugin"><a class="header" href="#build-the-sample-plugin">Build the sample plugin</a></h3>
<p>To compile a plugin, simply open a command prompt in the plugin folder and run the <code>tmbuild.exe</code>
executable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cmd input">sample-projects/plugins/custom_tab&gt; %TM_SDK_DIR%/bin/tmbuild.exe

<li>Create a <code>libs</code> folder and download <code>premake5</code> into it. (You can set the <code>TM_LIB_DIR</code> environment
variable to use a shared <code>libs</code> directory for all your projects.)</li>
<li>Run <code>premake5</code> to create a Visual Studio project from the <code>premake5.lua</code> script.</li>

<p>This walkthrough shows you how to add a custom Tab to the Engine.</p>
<p>During this walkthrough, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to create a tab from scratch.</li>
<li>Where and how do we register the Tab to the Engine.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should have basic knowledge about how to write a custom plugin. If not, you might want to check this <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book/extending_the_machinery/the_plugin_system.html">Guide</a> and the <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book/extending_the_machinery/write-a-plugin.html#build-requirements">Write a plugin guide</a>. The goal of this walkthrough is to dissect the Tab plugin provided by the Engine.</p>

<p>In this example, we want to create a new plugin, which contains our Tab. We open the Engine go to <strong>file -&gt; New Plugin -&gt; Editor Tab.</strong> The file dialog will pop up and ask us where we want to save our file. Pick a location that suits you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Maybe store your plugin in a folder next to your game project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After this, we see that the Engine created some files for us.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/jhrqv8t8bbhr20u/tm_tut_new_tab.png?dl=1" alt="folder structure new plugin" /></p>
<p>Now we need to ensure that we can build our project. In the root folder (The folder with the premake file), we can run <code>tmbuild</code> and see if there is no issue. We will build our projects once and generate the <code>.sln</code> file (on windows). </p>
<p>If there is an issue, we should ensure we have set up the Environment variables correctly and installed all the needed dependencies. For more information, please read this <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book/helper_tools/tmbuild.html">guide</a>.</p>

The <code>create_menu_name</code> is an optional function to allow you to provide a name for the create tab menu. In contrast, the <code>title()</code> function is not optional and is needed.

<p>The <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/plugins/ui/docking.h.html#structtm_docking_api"><code>tm_docking_api</code></a>, which will call our Tab's update, provides us with the essential information:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tm_tab_o* tab</code> our tab data to access any data we need</li>
<li><code>tm_ui_o* ui</code> an instance of the UI, needed to call the <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/plugins/ui/ui.h.html#structtm_ui_api"><code>tm_ui_api</code></a></li>
<li><code>const tm_ui_style_t* uistyle_in</code> an instance of the current UI style, can be used to create a local version of it to modify the UI Style for this Tab.</li>
<li><code>tm_rect_t rect</code> the render surface of the Tab.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the first line of the function body, we create a new instance of the UI Buffers. You may use them to access the underlying buffers for calls to the<a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/plugins/ui/draw2d.h.html#structtm_draw2d_api"><code>tm_draw2d_api</code></a>.Also, this object allows access to the commonly shared metrics and colors.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">tm_ui_buffers_t uib = tm_ui_api-&gt;buffers(ui);
</code></pre>
<p>After this, we define our local copy of the UI Style. Then we create an empty <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/plugins/ui/draw2d.h.html#structtm_draw2d_style_t"><code>tm_draw2d_style_t</code></a> instance. We need to create a Style from the UI Style. You need <code> tm_draw2d_style_t* style</code> later for drawing anything with our draw 2d api.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">tm_ui_buffers_t uib = tm_ui_api-&gt;buffers(ui);

tm_ui_api-&gt;to_draw_style(ui, style, uistyle);
</code></pre>
<p>Now we are set, and we can finally color our tab background to red. You can do this with the <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/plugins/ui/draw2d.h.html#structtm_draw2d_api.fill_rect()"><code>tm_draw2d_api.fill_rect()</code></a> call. Beforehand we need to change our style's color to red and then call the <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/plugins/ui/draw2d.h.html#structtm_draw2d_api.fill_rect()"><code>tm_draw2d_api.fill_rect()</code></a>. We need to pass in the vertex buffer and the index buffer pointer so the function can draw into them.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">style-&gt;color = (tm_color_srgb_t){.a = 255, .r = 255};

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="plugin-assets"><a class="header" href="#plugin-assets">Plugin assets</a></h1>
<p>When you put a plugin in the <code>plugin</code> folder, it will be loaded every time you start The Machinery
and used by all projects. This is convenient, but sometimes you want plugins that are project
specific, e.g., the gameplay code for a particular game.</p>
<p><strong>Table of Content</strong></p>

</ul>
<h2 id="the-two-ways-of-achieving-plugin-only-assets"><a class="header" href="#the-two-ways-of-achieving-plugin-only-assets">The two ways of achieving plugin only assets</a></h2>
<p>There are two ways of doing this.</p>
<p>First, you could create a separate The Machinery executable folder for that specific project. Just
make a copy of the The Machinery folder and add any plugins you need. Whenever you want to work on
that project, make sure to start that executable instead of the standard one.</p>
<p>In addition to adding project specific plugins, this method also lets you do additional things,
such as using different versions of The Machinery for different projects and remove any of the
standard plugins that you <em>don't</em> need in your project.</p>
<p>The second method is to store plugins as <em>assets</em> in the project itself. To do this, create a <em>New
Plugin</em> in the <em>Asset Browser</em> and set the DLL path of the plugin to your DLL. We call this a 
<em>Plugin Asset</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>Plugin Assets</em> will be loaded whenever you open the project and unloaded whenever you close
the project. Since the plugin is distributed with the project, if you send the project to someone,
they will automatically get the plugin too -- they don't have to manually install into their
<code>plugin</code> folder. This can be a convenient way of distributing plugins.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>WARNING: Security Warning</strong></p>
<p>Since plugin assets can contain arbitrary code and there is no sandboxing, when you run a
plugin asset, it will have full access to your machine. Therefore, you should only run plugin
assets from trusted sources. When you open a project that contains plugin assets, you will 
be asked if you want to allow the code to run on your machine or not. You should only click
<em>[Allow]</em> if you trust the author of the project.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE: Version Issues</strong></p>
<p>Since The Machinery is still in early adopters mode and doesn't have a stable API, plugins will only work
with the specific version they are developed for. If you send a plugin to someone else
(for example as a plugin asset in a project), you must make sure that they use the exact same
version of The Machinery. Otherwise, the plugin will most likely crash.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="how-to-create-a-plugin-asset"><a class="header" href="#how-to-create-a-plugin-asset">How to create a plugin asset</a></h2>
<p>You can create a plugin asset in the Asset Browser. <strong>Righ Click -&gt; New -&gt; New Plugin</strong>. This will create a plugin asset in your asset browser. On its own this is quite useless. When you select it you can set the DLL Path for your plugin on windows or on linux. The moment you have selected the path to the dll. It will be imported and stored in the asset.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The asset plugin will store the path absolute.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The plugin asset settings look as following:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/hc12tcagz448ffz/tm_guide_plugin_asset.png?dl=1" alt="" /></p>
<p>You would have to repeat the above described workflow every time you change the code of your plugin. This is very annoying, but do not worry hot-reloading comes to rescue!</p>
<p>You can enable hot-reload for plugin assets by checking the <strong><em>Import When Changed</em> checkbox (1)</strong> in the plugin
properties. If checked, the editor will monitor the plugin's import path for changes and if it
detects a file change, it will reimport the plugin.</p>
<p>The <strong>Windows &amp; Linux DLL Path (2)</strong> can be used to provide the path to the DLLs for the importing the plugin. Plugin Assets need to obey the same rules as normal plugins. Therefore they need to provide the <code>TM_DLL_EXPORT void tm_load_plugin(struct tm_api_registry_api *reg, bool load)</code> function. In case this is not possible because the DLL is a helper the helper check box can be called.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="hot-reloading"><a class="header" href="#hot-reloading">Hot-Reloading</a></h1>
<p>We support hot-reloading of plugins while <em>The Machinery</em> is running. This allows you to work on a
plugin and see the changes in real-time without having to shut down and restart the application
between each change to your code.</p>
<p>Hot-reloading is enabled by default, but can be disabled with the <code>--no-hot-reload</code> parameter.</p>
<p>When a reload happens, the function pointers in the plugin's API struct are replaced with function
pointers to the new code. Since clients hold pointers to this struct, they will use the new function
pointers automatically -- they don't have to re-query the system for the API.</p>
<p>Note that hot-reloading is not magical and can break in a lot of situations. For example, if you
remove functions in the API or change their parameters, any clients of your API will still try to
call them using the old parameter lists, and things will most likely crash. Similarly, if a client
has stashed away a function pointer to one of your API functions somewhere, such as in a list of
callbacks, there is no way for us to patch that copy and it will continue to call the old code.
Also, if you make changes to the layout of live data objects (such as adding or removing struct
fields) things will break because we make no attempts to transfer the data to the new struct
format.</p>
<p>But adding or removing static functions, or changing the code inside functions should work without
problems. We find hot-reloading to be a big time saver even if it doesn't work in all circumstances.</p>
<p>If you want to use global variables in your DLL you should do so using the
<code>tm_api_registry_api-&gt;static_variable()</code> function in your <code>tm_load_plugin()</code> code. If you just
declare a global variable in your .c file, that variable will be allocated in the DLLs memory space
and when the DLL is reloaded you will lose all changes to the variable. When you use
<code>static_variable()</code>, the variable is allocated on the heap, and its content is preserved when the
DLL is reloaded.</p>
<p>If you are using hot-reloading together with a debugger on Windows, be aware that the debugger will
lock <code>.pdb</code> files which will prevent you from rebuilding your code. The suggested workflow is
something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Detach the debugger if it's currently attached.</li>
<li>Rebuild your DLL and fix any compiler bugs.</li>
<li>When the DLL is built successfully, The Machinery will automatically reload it.</li>
<li>If you need to continue debugging, re-attach the debugger.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="application-hooks"><a class="header" href="#application-hooks">Application Hook's</a></h1>
<p>The Machinery allows you to hook your code into specific customization points. Those points happen in different phases and have specific purposes. The biggest difference between the Runner and the Editor is that only the customization points differ in the central update loop.</p>

<p>Maintaining different <em>Makefiles</em> and <em>Visual Studio Solution</em> files for a cross platform project can be a lot of work. Especially since you have to adjust the generator a lot for every new platform you support.</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing <a href="https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/%7Enewhall/unixhelp/howto_makefiles.html">Makefiles</a> even for the simplest projects can be a tedious effort without automation, and it is difficult to debug.</li>
<li>Visual Studio Solution and Project Files are pre-generated, but are not designed to be easy to edit by hand, so resolving merge conflicts with them can be frustrating.</li>
</ul>
<p>Several build tools exist that allow us to avoid these issues. <a href="https://cmake.org/">CMake</a> is widely used, but tends to have a high learning curve and its scripting language is not the easiest to learn. Moreover it can very hard to debug.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-premake"><a class="header" href="#what-is-premake">What is premake</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://premake.github.io/">Premake5</a> is a Lightweight, Open-source, Lua-based alternative to CMake. As with CMake, Premake allows you to define the structure and contents of your project and then dynamically generate whatever build files (Makefiles, VS Solutions, Xcode Projects, etc) you need at the time.</p>
<p>At the core of Premake5 is a <strong>premake5.lua</strong> file that describes your project (what programming language it uses, where to find source files, what dependencies it has, etc.). ‘<strong>premake5.lua</strong>’ is to <em><strong>Premake</strong></em> what is ‘<strong>Makefile</strong>’ is to <em><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">GNU Make</a></em> or a project/sln file to Visual Studios.</p>
<p>Because <em>premake5.lua</em> allows you to uniquely generate whatever build files you need in seconds, you no longer need to version them in your repository. You configure your version control to <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore">ignore</a> the build files, and version the premake5.lua file instead. Resolving merge conflicts on a premake5.lua file is far more sane than on a Visual Studio project file.</p>
<p>Once you have a premake5.lua file, you can run the premake executable to generate your desired project files. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>To generate a Makefile on Linux you run <code>./premake5 vs20122</code></li>
<li>To generate a VS 2022 Solution on Windows you run <code>premake5 vs2022</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Wow this is a lot of code ... lets talk about the basics: <code>filter </code>, <code>workspace</code> and <code>project</code></p>
<p><code>filter {...}</code> allows you to set a filter for a specific configuiration or option.  For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">filter &quot;configurations:Debug&quot;
    defines { &quot;TM_CONFIGURATION_DEBUG&quot;, &quot;DEBUG&quot; }
    symbols &quot;On&quot;
    filter &quot;system:windows&quot;
        set_debugger_to_engine() -- sets the debugger in VS Studio to point to the_machinery.exe

filter &quot;configurations:Release&quot;
    defines { &quot;TM_CONFIGURATION_RELEASE&quot; }
    optimize &quot;On&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>This example tells Premake5 that on Debug we have the define <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/api_types.h.html#tm_configuration_debug"><code>TM_CONFIGURATION_DEBUG</code></a> and we generate debug symbols : <code>symbols &quot;On&quot;</code> and only on windows we make sure that we point to the right debugger:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">    filter &quot;system:windows&quot;
        set_debugger_to_engine() -- sets the debugger in VS Studio to point to the_machinery.exe
</code></pre>
<p>With this knowlege we still have not reduced the amount of code to think about! Yes that is right so lets just say: We can ignore 90% of the premake file and just take it as it is and only focus on the really important aspects:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">--- more code we can ignore
workspace &quot;test-plugin&quot;
    configurations {&quot;Debug&quot;, &quot;Release&quot;}
    language &quot;C++&quot;
    cppdialect &quot;C++11&quot;
    flags { &quot;FatalWarnings&quot;, &quot;MultiProcessorCompile&quot; }
    warnings &quot;Extra&quot;
    inlining &quot;Auto&quot;
    sysincludedirs { &quot;&quot; }
    targetdir &quot;bin/%{cfg.buildcfg}&quot;
--- more code we can ignore
project &quot;test-plugin&quot;
    location &quot;build/test-plugin&quot;
    targetname &quot;test-plugin&quot;
    kind &quot;SharedLib&quot;
    language &quot;C++&quot;
    files {&quot;*.inl&quot;, &quot;*.h&quot;, &quot;*.c&quot;}
</code></pre>
<p>This defines our workspace. This woul be in VS our Solution:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">workspace &quot;test-plugin&quot; --- The name of the Workspace == The Solution name in VS
    configurations {&quot;Debug&quot;, &quot;Release&quot;} -- The configurations we offer
    language &quot;C++&quot; -- The Language in this case C++
    cppdialect &quot;C++11&quot; 
    flags { &quot;FatalWarnings&quot;, &quot;MultiProcessorCompile&quot; } -- We treat warnings as errors and can compile with more cores
    warnings &quot;Extra&quot; -- That we basically show all warnings
    inlining &quot;Auto&quot;
    sysincludedirs { &quot;&quot; } -- making sure we have the system includes
    targetdir &quot;bin/%{cfg.buildcfg}&quot; -- where do we store our binary files, not our .d files etc...
</code></pre>
<p>The next important aspect is the project itself:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">project &quot;test-plugin&quot; -- The name of the project in VS or the target in the Makefile
    location &quot;build/test-plugin&quot; -- Where do we want to store all our artifacts such as .d .obj etc
    targetname &quot;test-plugin&quot; -- The name of our executable, shared lib or static lib?
    kind &quot;SharedLib&quot; -- What kind? StaticLib, SharedLib, Executable?
    language &quot;C++&quot;-- What is our languge of implemntation? 
    files {&quot;*.inl&quot;, &quot;*.h&quot;, &quot;*.c&quot;} -- What files do we want to automagically include in our project?
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to add a new project to your premake file you can just add a new block such as the one above to to your premake file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">project &quot;new-project&quot; 
    location &quot;build/new-project&quot; 
    targetname &quot;new-project&quot; 
    kind &quot;SharedLib&quot; 
    language &quot;C&quot;
	cppdialect &quot;C11&quot; -- you can also add other things here!
    files {&quot;*.inl&quot;, &quot;*.h&quot;, &quot;*.c&quot;} 
</code></pre>
<p>This adds a new project called <code>new-project</code> to your premake file when you compile now the dll with the name `<code>new-project</code>will be build on Windows on Linux it will be a<code>.so\</code> file.</p>
<h2 id="advanced-premake5-adding-functions-to-make-our-live-easier"><a class="header" href="#advanced-premake5-adding-functions-to-make-our-live-easier">Advanced Premake5: Adding functions to make our live easier</a></h2>
<p>The code example above is great but its quite a lot of work. This is something you can change. Since Premake5 is using Lua you can just write functions to bundle your code together. For example lets say we want a base for all our projects:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">function base(name)
    project(name)
        language &quot;C++&quot;
        includedirs { &quot;&quot; }
end
</code></pre>
<p>And than we want to make sure that our plugins (.dlls) are all the same but easy to use:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">function plugin(name)
    local sn = snake_case(name) -- function that converts a name to snake case
    base(name)
        location(&quot;build/plugins/&quot; .. sn)
        kind &quot;SharedLib&quot;
        targetdir &quot;bin/%{cfg.buildcfg}/plugins&quot;
        targetname(&quot;tm_&quot; .. sn)
        defines {&quot;TM_LINKS_&quot; .. string.upper(sn)}
        dependson(&quot;foundation&quot;)
        folder {&quot;plugins/&quot; .. sn}
        language &quot;C++&quot;
        includedirs { &quot;&quot; } -- A override (see above) that makes sure we have the right include dir also with the SDK dirs
end
</code></pre>
<p>This allows us to re-write our example from above:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">plugin(&quot;test-plugin&quot;)
plugin(&quot;new-project&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Moreover we need a utility tool? No problem we can just write a function for this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">-- Project type for utility programs
function util(name)
    local sn = snake_case(name)
    base(name)
        location(&quot;build/&quot; .. sn)
        kind &quot;ConsoleApp&quot;
        targetdir &quot;bin/%{cfg.buildcfg}&quot;
        defines { &quot;TM_LINKS_FOUNDATION&quot; }
        dependson { &quot;foundation&quot; }
        links { &quot;foundation&quot; }
        folder {&quot;utils/&quot; .. sn}
        filter { &quot;platforms:Linux&quot; }
            linkoptions {&quot;-ldl&quot;, &quot;-lanl&quot;, &quot;-pthread&quot;}
        filter {} -- clear filter for future calls
end
</code></pre>
<p>This allows for the following lines of code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">plugin(&quot;test-plugin&quot;)
plugin(&quot;new-project&quot;)
util(&quot;my-untility&quot;)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="the-machinery-project-recommendation"><a class="header" href="#the-machinery-project-recommendation">The Machinery Project Recommendation</a></h2>
<p>We recommend you to make use of one single premake file that manages all your plugins at one build. This avoids the need to go in each of the folder to build your project. As recommended in the the chapter <a href="extending_the_machinery/./getting_started/project_setup.html#possible-folder-structure-for-a-project">Project Setup: Possible folder structure for a project</a> we recommend also to seperate your plugins into sub folders. The following image shows a potential setup for your game plugins:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/l1429g7p5xx8kj2/tm_guide_possible_subfolder.png?dl=1" alt="" /></p>
<p>In here we have one single <code>premake</code> file and a single <code>libs.json</code> as well as the <code>libs</code> folder. This allows you to run <code>tmbuild</code> just in this folder and all plugins or the ones you want to build can be built at once. </p>
<p>In this case the premake file could look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">-- premake5.lua

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="gameplay-coding-in-the-machinery"><a class="header" href="#gameplay-coding-in-the-machinery">Gameplay Coding in The Machinery</a></h1>
<p>In this section, you will learn the basics about Gameplay Coding in <em>The Machinery.</em> There are two primary ways of creating a vivid and active world:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using our C APIs <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/apidoc.html">API Documentation</a>.</li>
<li>Using the <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book/editing_workflows/visual-scripting.html">Visual Scripting Language</a>, which you can extend as well.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="coding-within-our-entity-component-system"><a class="header" href="#coding-within-our-entity-component-system">Coding within our Entity Component System</a></h2>
<p>The Machinery uses an Entity Component System; therefore, most of your gameplay code will run via Engines or Systems. To learn more about these, please follow this <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book//gameplay_coding/ecs/index.html">link</a>.</p>
<h2 id="general-code-entry-points-using-simulation-entry-component"><a class="header" href="#general-code-entry-points-using-simulation-entry-component">General code entry points using Simulation Entry Component</a></h2>
<p>The Machinery also offers you a Simulation Entry Component which will, when the parent entity is spawned, set up a system with that is used to run code at start-up and each frame. Read more <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book/gameplay_coding/simulation_entry.html">here</a>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="simulation-entry-writing-gameplay-code-in-c"><a class="header" href="#simulation-entry-writing-gameplay-code-in-c">Simulation Entry (writing gameplay code in C)</a></h2>
<p>This walkthrough will show you how to create a <em>simulation entry</em> and what a simulation entry is.</p>
<p>If you wish to program gameplay using C code, then you need some way for this code to execute. You can either make lots of entity components that do inter-component communication, but if you want a more classic monolithic approach, then you can use a simulation entry.</p>
<p>In order for your code to execute using a simulation entry you need two things. Firstly you need an implementation of the Simulation Entry interface, <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/plugins/simulation/simulation_entry.h.html#structtm_simulation_entry_i"><code>tm_simulation_entry_i</code></a> (see <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/plugins/simulation/simulation_entry.h.html#simulation_entry.h"><code>simulation_entry.h</code></a>) and secondly you need a Simulation Entry Component attached to an entity.</p>
<p>Define a <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/plugins/simulation/simulation_entry.h.html#structtm_simulation_entry_i"><code>tm_simulation_entry_i</code></a> in a plugin like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">static tm_simulation_entry_i simulation_entry_i = {
    .id = TM_STATIC_HASH(&quot;tm_my_game_simulation_entry&quot;, 0x2d5f7dad50097045ULL),
    .display_name = TM_LOCALIZE_LATER(&quot;My Game Simulate Entry&quot;),
    .start = start,
    .stop = stop,
    .tick = tick,
    .hot_reload = hot_reload,
};
</code></pre>
<p>Where <code>start</code>, <code>stop</code> and <code>tick</code> are functions that are run when the simulation starts, stop and each frame respectively. Make sure that <code>id</code> is a unique identifier.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> There is also a plugin template available that does this, see <code>File -&gt; New Plugin -&gt; Simulation Entry</code> with The Machinery Editor. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> to generate the <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/api_types.h.html#tm_static_hash()"><code>TM_STATIC_HASH</code></a> you need to run <code>hash.exe</code> or <code>tmbuild.exe --gen-hash</code> for more info open the <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book//helper_tools/hash.html">hash.exe guide</a></p>

<p>When your plugin loads (each plugin has a <code>tm_load_plugin</code> function), make sure to register this implementation of <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/plugins/simulation/simulation_entry.h.html#structtm_simulation_entry_i"><code>tm_simulation_entry_i</code></a> on the <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/plugins/simulation/simulation_entry.h.html#structtm_simulation_entry_i"><code>tm_simulation_entry_i</code></a> interface name, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">tm_add_or_remove_implementation(reg, load, tm_simulation_entry_i, &amp;simulation_entry_i);
</code></pre>
<p>When this is done and your plugin is loaded, you can add a Simulation Entry Component to any entity and select your registered implementation. Now, whenever you run a simulation (using Simulate Tab or from a Published build) where this entity is present, your code will run.</p>
<p>The same Simulation Entry interface can be used from multiple Simulation Entry Components and their state will <em>not</em> be shared between them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> For more in-depth examples, we refer to the gameplay samples, they all use Simulation Entry.</p>

<h2 id="what-happens-under-the-hood"><a class="header" href="#what-happens-under-the-hood">What happens under the hood?</a></h2>
<p>When the Simulation Entry Component is loaded within the Simulate Tab or Runner, it will set up an entity system. This system will run your start, stop and tick functions. You may then ask, what is the difference between using a Simulation Entry and just registering a system from your plugin? The answer is the lifetime of the code. If you register a system from your plugin, then that system will run no matter what entity is spawned whereas the Simulation Entry Component will add and remove the system that runs your code when the entity is spawned and despawned.</p>

<p>The <em>Entity Graph</em> implements a visual scripting language based on nodes and connections. To use
it, right-click on an entity to add a Graph Component and then double click on the Graph Component
to open it in the Graph Editor:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ssasbp5sb0vq7gy/graph-editor.png?dl=1" alt="Graph editor." /></p>

<h3 id="how-to-use-the-entity-graph"><a class="header" href="#how-to-use-the-entity-graph">How to use the Entity Graph?</a></h3>
<p>You need to add a Graph Component to an Entity of your choice. </p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/29u0c1gsu0vjghg/tm_guide_entity_graph_add_component.png?dl=1" alt="" /></p>
<p>After that, you have two ways of opening the Graph:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Double Click the Graph Component</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click in the Property View on Edit</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/p1hkay3ouhezbmh/tm_guide_entity_graph_open.gif?dl=1" alt="" /></p>
<p>Now the Graph Editor Opens and you can start adding nodes via:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Right Click -&gt; Add Node</strong></li>
<li><strong>Press Space</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="execution"><a class="header" href="#execution">Execution</a></h3>
<p>The Entity Graph is an event-driven Visual Scripting language. This means everything happens after an event is triggered! By default, the Engine comes with the following built-in Events:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Init Event</td><td>Is called when the component is added to the Entity.</td><td><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/6cov2jbv72iy455/tm_guide_entity_graph_init.png?dl=1" width="277" height="120"></td></tr>

<h3 id="anatomy"><a class="header" href="#anatomy">Anatomy</a></h3>
<p>There are six types of nodes:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Function</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Event Node</td><td>Starting point of the Execution</td></tr>
<tr><td>Query Node</td><td>Query nodes are triggered  automatically when their output is requested. Nodes that aren't query nodes need to be triggered. Therefore they are &quot;Pure&quot; and do not modify data!</td></tr>
<tr><td>Nodes</td><td>Normal nodes that have an Event input, hence they might modify the data and produce an output or mutate the graphs state!</td></tr>
<tr><td>Subgraphs</td><td>Graphs within a Graph! Allow you to organize your graph into smaller units. They can also be reused if saved as Subgraph Prototype.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Input Node</td><td>Accepts Input from the Outside world and makes it available to the graph. Mainly used for communication between graphs and subgraphs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Output Node</td><td>Accepts Output and passes it to the Outside world and makes it available to a parent graph. Mainly used for communication between graphs and subgraphs.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Moreover, the Visual Scripting language knows two different types of wires:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Event Wires</strong> They regulate the execution flow.</li>
<li><strong>Data Wires</strong> Transport the data from node to node!</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/i95s1frdzhcsev1/tm_guide_entity_graph_wire_types.png?dl=1" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="inputs"><a class="header" href="#inputs">Inputs</a></h2>
<p>Graphs can have inputs. They can be used to allow the user of your graph to pass data from the outside (e.g. the Editor) to the graph. This happens via the Input Nodes. In the General Graph settings you can add Inputs from the outside world.</p>
<h3 id="adding-a-public-input"><a class="header" href="#adding-a-public-input">Adding a Public Input</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>You click on the Settings button which opens the Graphs Settings</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/na7s582ljyxmnnf/tm_guide_entity_graph_settings.png?dl=1" alt="image" /></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>You expand the Input Accordion and press &quot;Add&quot;</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/hv7qiqqhy4gbauw/tm_guide_entity_graph_add_input.png?dl=1" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you now select the Graph Component of your Entity you will be able to change the value:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ojite1pycbs75pq/tm_guide_entity_graph_input_node_public.png?dl=1" alt="" /></p>
<p>This can be a nice way to customize behaviour of your graph and entity!</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>Add an Input node to your graph. There you have access to the data.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/l20w7d0utoet9ti/tm_guide_entity_graph_input_node.png?dl=1" alt="" /></p>
<p>The Input Node also allows you to access the settings. Hover over the name of the Input and a Settings option becomes available. </p>

</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="variables"><a class="header" href="#variables">Variables</a></h3>
<p>You can store data within your Graph! The Set / Get Variable nodes are the way to go. They give you access to this function. You can also access variables from distance Entities by using the Set / Get Remote Variable nodes.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/dgddk1xmw16dlp1/tm_guide_entity_graph_create_remote_variable.png?dl=1" alt="" /></p>
<h3 id="branches-and-loops"><a class="header" href="#branches-and-loops">Branches and loops</a></h3>
<p>The Language comes with built-in support for branches, the If node. The Language supports multiple bool operators to compare values.</p>
<p>Besides, you have two nodes for loops:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Grid node</li>
<li>The For node</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The Grid node for example:</em></p>

<h3 id="subgraphs"><a class="header" href="#subgraphs">Subgraphs</a></h3>
<p>You can organize your code into smaller reusable units and combine nodes as a subgraph! Using subgraphs makes your Graph more user-friendly, and it will look less like spaghetti. You can store your subgraph as a <code>.entity_graph</code> asset in your asset browser and allow it to be reused across your project! Which enables you to have maximal flexibility! </p>
<h2 id="what-is-next-5"><a class="header" href="#what-is-next-5">What is next?</a></h2>
<p>In the next chapter you will learn more about Subgraphs and the Debugger! In case you want to provide your own Nodes check out this tutorial <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/tutorials/gameplay_coding/extend_the_entity_graph.html">Extend the Entity Graph</a></p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="subgraphs-1"><a class="header" href="#subgraphs-1">Subgraphs</a></h1>
<p>Subgraphs are a way to organize your graph better and create smaller units. They make them easier to maintain and easy to follow. In its essence a subgraph is a graph within a graph. They are interfaced via a subgraph node. They can produce Input and Output, such as a normal node could. They can also call and react to normal Events!</p>
<h2 id="create-a-subgraph"><a class="header" href="#create-a-subgraph">Create a subgraph</a></h2>
<p>You create a new subgraph by simply selecting all nodes that shall be part of the subgraph. After that, click on them with the right mouse and select Create Subgraph from the context menu**.** The subgraph will replace the selected nodes. You can change its label in the property view. By simply double click you open the subgraph.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/k688sg41w5507mn/tm_guide_entity_graph_create_subgraph.gif?dl=1" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="subgraph-inputs"><a class="header" href="#subgraph-inputs">Subgraph Inputs</a></h2>
<p>A subgraph can have inputs and outputs. You can add them to them the same way as for a normal Graph. But you can also just connect the needed wires with the subgraph node, as the following image shows:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/18b2z2f1ed80ex6/tm_guide_entity_graph_create_subgraph_input_output.gif?dl=1" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="subgraph-prototypes"><a class="header" href="#subgraph-prototypes">Subgraph Prototypes</a></h2>
<p>The Machinery's  <strong>Prototype</strong> system allows you to create, configure, and store an Entity/Creation Graph complete with all its subgraphs, input/output nodes as a reusable Entity / Creation Graph Asset. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Since the Entity Graph and the Creation Graph are conceptually similar the same aspects apply to them both! However this document will only focus on the Entity Graph.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This Asset acts as a template from which you can create new Prototype instances in other Entity Graphs/Creation Graphs. Any edits that you make to the Asset are automatically reflected in the instances of that Graph, allowing you to easily make broad changes across your whole Project without having to repeatedly make the same edit to every copy of the Asset.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This does not mean all Prototype instances are identical. You can override individually and add/remove nodes from them, depending on your need!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="create-a-subgraph-prototype"><a class="header" href="#create-a-subgraph-prototype">Create a subgraph Prototype</a></h3>
<p>You can turn a subgraph into a prototype by simply using the context menu of the subgraph node and selecting Create Subgraph prototype. This will create a Subgraph Prototype Asset (<code>.entity_graph</code>) in your Asset Browser. When you open it you are opening the instanced version. Any change to this version will not be shared across all other versions! Only changes made to the prototype will propagate to all changes! To open a prototype you can use the &quot;Open Prototype&quot; Button. </p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/kstww1jbo3dpvwj/tm_guide_entity_graph_create_subgraph_prototype.gif?dl=1" alt="" /></p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="debugger"><a class="header" href="#debugger">Debugger</a></h1>
<p>The Entity Graph has a Debugger. You can use this Debugger to inspect the current values or set a breakpoint to see if the Graph behaves the way it should. Besides the graph indicated if a node is executed by a highlighted border!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>  The Debugger only works if the simulate tab and the graph tab are open at the same time!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/80ld50b4n6ohjio/tm_guide_entity_graph_debugger_basic.png?dl=1" alt="" /></p>
<p>You can find the Debugger when you click on the button in the upper toolbar with the bug symbol <strong>(1)</strong>. It will open the Debugger Overlay. Besides the &quot;Bug&quot; button, you can find a dropdown menu <strong>(2)</strong>. This dropdown menu lets you switch between Graph instances quickly. This is useful if the Graph is part of an Entity Prototype or itself a Subgraph prototype! </p>
<h2 id="debug-overlay"><a class="header" href="#debug-overlay">Debug Overlay</a></h2>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/wly93rk8vz97upm/tm_guide_entity_graph_debug_overlay.png?dl=1" alt="" /></p>
<p>In this overlay, you find three-tab:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Watch Wires;</strong> Contains all data wires you are watching.</li>
<li><strong>Breakpoints;</strong> This Contains a list of all Breakpoints within this Graph and its subgraph</li>
<li><strong>Instances;</strong> A list of all instances of this Graph</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="watch-wires"><a class="header" href="#watch-wires">Watch Wires</a></h2>
<p>Like in a normal code editor, you can hover over any data wire and observe the values during the execution. If a value changed, it would be red, otherwise white.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/cw86wtsfcb8sg50/tm_guide_entity_graph_watch_wires.png?dl=1" alt="" /></p>
<p>This might be cucumber some and difficult for observing multiple wires. This is why you can add them to the watch wire list.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/1j09t2vxxk4t11b/tm_guide_entity_graph_add_watch_wires.png?dl=1" alt="" /></p>
<p>The Watch Wire list will indicate as well if a value has changed. You can also remove them there again and find the node with the find node button.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/lpx1duqf5lpee0n/tm_guide_entity_graph_watch_wires_overlay.png?dl=1" alt="" /></p>
<p>Keep in mind that this list only works within the current graph instance and its subgraph.</p>
<h2 id="breakpoints"><a class="header" href="#breakpoints">Breakpoints</a></h2>
<p>Unlike watching wires which require no extra step, you cannot just add a breakpoint, and it will break immediately since such behaviour could be annoying. You can add breakpoints at any point in time via <strong>Right-Click on a node</strong> -&gt; <strong>Add Breakpoint.</strong> </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can only add breakpoints to all nodes besides Event and Query nodes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/us6lrw5ad9qpcbg/tm_guide_entity_graph_add_breakpoints.png?dl=1" alt="" /></p>
<p>To activate the breakpoints, you need to connect to the Simulation by pressing the Connect Button in the Debug Overlay.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/34jbcvkt49814kk/tm_guide_entity_graph_connect.png?dl=1" alt="" /></p>
<p>(<em>Alternatively, the Breakpoint Overview will inform you that you need to connect to the Simulation)</em></p>
<p>The moment you are connected, the Simulation will react appropriately, and your breakpoints will happen.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/26awwgjzz93mcu4/tm_guide_entity_graph_debug_mode.png?dl=1" alt="" /></p>
<ol>
<li>You can disconnect from the Simulation.</li>
<li>You can continue till the next breakpoint hits.</li>

<p>This section of the book shall help you understand how to make use of our Entity Component System. Designing games with an ECS can be overwhelming. Especially if you come from a more traditional background: Object Oriented Approaches. This chapter will provide you with the basic understanding of what an ECS is and how you can use it!. </p>
<p>Let us begin with the purpose of the entity system! Its purpose is it to provide a flexible model for <em>objects in a simulation</em>, that
allows us to compose complex objects from simpler components in a flexible and performant way. An <em>entity</em> is a game object composed of <em>components</em>. Entities live in a <em>entity context</em> — an isolated world of entities. In the Machinery each of the following tabs has its own Entity Context: Simulate Tab, Scene Tab, Preview Tab. Entities within those tabs only exist within these contexts! Each new instance of the tab has a different context! Entities are composed of components. They are there to hold the needed data while <em>Engines</em>/<em>Systems</em> are there to provide behaviour. Each context (<em>entity context</em>) can have a number of <em>engines</em> or <em>systems</em> registered. <em>(ECS)</em> Engine updates are running on a subset of entities that posses some set of components. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: in some entity systems, these are referred to as <em>systems</em> instead, but we choose <em>engine</em>, because it is less ambiguous.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While Systems are just an update with a provided access to the entity context. When we refer to a context in this chapter we mean the entity context.</p>

<p>An entity is the fundamental part of the Entity Component System. An entity is a handle to your data. The entity itself does not store any data or behavior.  The data is stored in components, which are associated with the Entity. The behavior is defined in Systems and Engines which process those components. Therefore an entity acts as an identifier or key to the data stored in components.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/5956267ltb4l14x/tm_guide_entity.png?dl=1" alt="" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In this example both entities have the same set of components, but they do not own the data they just refer to it!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Entities are managed by the Entity API and exist within an Entity Context. An Entity struct refers to an entity, but is not a real reference. Rather the Entity struct contains an index used to access entity data.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-an-entity-context"><a class="header" href="#what-is-an-entity-context">What is an Entity Context?</a></h2>
<p>The Entity Context is the simulation world. It contains all the Entities and Systems/Engines as well as owns all the Component Data. There can be multiple Entity Contexts in the Editor. For example the Simulate tag, Preview Tab have both an Entity Context. When you Register A System/Engine you can decide in which context they shall run. The Default is in all contexts. </p>
<h2 id="where-do-entities-live-lifecycle"><a class="header" href="#where-do-entities-live-lifecycle">Where do Entities live? (Lifecycle)</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Entities <strong>do not live in The Truth</strong>. The truth is for <em>assets</em>, not for <em>simulation.</em></li>
<li>Entity data is owned by the entity context and thrown away when the entity context is destroyed.</li>
<li>Entities can be spawned from <em>entity assets</em> in The Truth. Multiple entities can be spawned from
the same asset.</li>
<li>Changes to entity assets can be propagated into a context where those assets are spawned. This is
the main way in which we will provide a “preview” of assets in a simulation context.</li>
<li>An entity always belongs to a specific entity context and entity IDs are only unique within the entity contexts. Entities can be created and deleted dynamically. When entities are deleted, the existing handles to that entity are no longer valid. Entity IDs act as weak references. If you have an ID you can ask the context whether that entity is still alive or not. <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/plugins/entity/entity.h.html#structtm_entity_api.is_alive()"><code>tm_entity_api.is_alive()</code></a></li>

<ul>
<li>An entity is a 64-bit value divided into a 32-bit index and a 32-bit generation.</li>

<p>You have a <code>Movement Controller Component</code> that can be used via the UI to determine the Entities movement speed.

<p>There are two problems in an ECS (Entity Component System) regarding the interaction between Entities: The <strong>read</strong> and the <strong>write</strong> access. </p>
<p>The truth about the interaction between Entities is that interactions do not genuinely exist. They are hidden beneath the implementation of the underlying relationship. A relationship is then nothing else than the transformation of data.</p>
<p>To choose the right tool for creating those transformations, we need to reason about our code (and what we want to achieve) and ask ourselves the following five questions: </p>
<ul>
<li>On what data do we operate? </li>
<li>What is our domain?</li>
<li>What is the possible input for our transformation? </li>
<li>What is the usage frequency of the data? </li>
<li>What are we actually transforming?</li>
<li>What could our algorithm look like? </li>
<li>How often do we perform our transformation?</li>
</ul>
<p>For infrequent read access we can easily use the <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/plugins/entity/entity.h.html#structtm_entity_api.get_component()"><code>tm_entity_api.get_component()</code></a> . It allows access to the underlying data directly from a provided entity. It is not recommended to use that for read-access because it is quite slow. You perform random data access. But again, if it is infrequent of the operation and the number of targets (Entities), which are interesting to choose the right tool.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here, you can use a System better than an <code>Engine</code>, since a System does not run in parallel and provides access to the Entity Context.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-problem"><a class="header" href="#the-problem">The problem</a></h2>
<p>When creating interactions between entities, we mainly face two types of problems:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Read Access:</strong> It means we have to read specific properties from a particular entity (object) and react based on this. <strong>In terms of games:</strong> An Actor needs to query/know some information from another part of the game. <strong>For example, within a Quest System:</strong> Have all tasks been completed?</li>
<li><strong>Write access:</strong> It means we have to write specific properties to a particular entity (object).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The transformation from *Interaction* towards *Relationships*</strong></p>
<p>To start this transformation, we should have a quick look at the first principle of <em>Data-Oriented Design</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Data is not the problem domain. For some, it would seem that data-oriented design is the antithesis of most other programming paradigms because data-oriented design is a technique that does not readily allow the problem domain to enter into the software so readily. It does not recognize the concept of an object in any way, as data is consistent without meaning […] The data-oriented design approach doesn’t build the real-world problem into the code. This could be seen as a failure of the data-oriented approach by veteran object-oriented developers, as many examples of the success of object-oriented design come from being able to bring human concepts to the machine. In this middle ground, a solution can be written in this language that is understandable by both humans and computers. The data-oriented approach gives up some of the human readability by leaving the problem domain in the design document but stops the machine from having to handle human concepts at any level by just that same action — <a href="http://www.dataorienteddesign.com/">Data Oriented Design Book Chapter 1.2</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This principle helps us recognize that interactions <em>do not truly exist. They hide the implementation of the underlying relationship</em>. A relationship is nothing else than a transformation of data. In the case of an ECS, the Entity Manager (In our case, Entity Context) can be seen as a database and the Entity as a Lookup table key that indexes relationships between components. </p>
<p>The systems (or engines) are just here to interpret those relationships and give them meaning. Therefore, a system and engines should only do one job and do this well. </p>
<p>Systems/Engines perform transformations of data. This understanding allows us to create generic systems which are decoupled and easy to reuse, and as such, we should keep the following in mind:</p>
<p>One of the main design goals for <em>Data-Oriented Design-driven</em> applications is to focus on reusability through decoupling whenever possible. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, the Unix philosophy <em>Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together — McIlroy</em> is a good way of expressing what a system/engine should do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most ECS's are built with the idea of relationships in mind. When writing systems/engines, we transform data from one state to another to give the data meaning. Therefore systems/engines are defining the purpose of the data relationships. This decoupling provides us with the flexibility we need to design complex software such as video games. </p>
<p>With such a design, we can modify behavior later on without breaking any dependencies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>For example:</em></p>
<p><em>You have one movement engine designed for the Player at first. Later on, you want to reuse it for all entities with a movement controller component. It contains the data provided by the Input System, such as which keys have been pressed. Therefore, an AI system can feed this as well for any other Unit (With the Movement Controller component, not the Player). The Movement Engine does not care about where the data comes from or who has it as long as it is present and the other needed component. (E.g. The Physics Mover or Transform)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>How do we design Systems?</strong></p>
<p>To implement the before-mentioned relationships, we have to undertake a couple of steps. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>These steps are also interesting for programmers who design gameplay systems. Having those fleshed out when they design game mechanics can be good and speed up your work. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have to ask the following questions:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> What data transformations are we going to do and on which data? </p>
<p>This question should lead to “what components do we need to create this relationship?” We should always be able to give a reason why we need this data.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> What is our possible domain? (What kind of inputs do we have?)</p>
<p>When we figure this out, we can make the right decision later. Also, we can reason about our code and how to implement these relationships.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> How often does the data change? </p>
<p>To determine how often we change the data, we go through component by component and discuss how often we change it. This process is vital to pick the right tool. Knowing those numbers or tendencies is great for reasoning about possible performance bottlenecks and where we could apply optimizations.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> What are we actually transforming?</p>
<p>Writing down the algorithm (in code or on paper) or the constraints of what we are actually doing with our data is a great solution.  To pick the right tool based on the planned algorithm, we need to consider the <strong>cost</strong> of our algorithm.</p>
<p>What does <strong>cost</strong> mean? It can mean anything from runtime costs to implementation costs. It is essential first to establish what the proper criteria are. The costs at the end enable us to reason about the code.</p>
<p>To pick the right tool, we need to reason about the costs an algorithm costs us. If we take run time performance as a measurement, it is okay to have a slow algorithm if we do not execute this frequently. If this is not the case, you should consider another solution.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> How often do we execute the algorithm/transformation?</p>
<p>Based on the information we have already about the data we need for the transformation, it’s pretty easy to determine the execution frequency. The total number of entities/objects is known at this time. (It may be an estimation). Therefore, we can guess how often this might run. Keep in mind that we previously discussed how often we suspect the data to be changed. This leads to transparency, which gives a good idea of the costs of this code.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the main goal is to keep things simple. A System/Engine should do one job. As the variety of components defines the data type of the Entity. And the combination of Systems/Engines defines the actual game behavior. Therefore you do not need to write diagrams, blueprints, pseudo-code or anything. You may even be able to just write the engine as one goal. It is recommended to do those steps even in your mind before you write your system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> When the data changes, the problem changes. Therefore, we have to properly evaluate with the descriptive method the possible outcome and maybe change the implementation.</p>

<p>In the Machinery, you provide the behavior for your gameplay code via Engines and Systems. The difference between Engines and Systems is that Engines provide an explicitly defined subset of components while Systems give you only access to the Entity Context.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Unsure what a System or an Engine is? Please read  <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book//gameplay_coding/ecs/index.html">here</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This separation means that Engines are better used for high-frequency operations on many entities. At the same time, Systems are better used for broader operations such as input on a few Entities / Single entities.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Documentation:</strong> The difference between <em>engines</em> and <em>systems</em> is that engines are fed component data, whereas systems are not. Thus, systems are useful when the data is stored externally from the components (for example to update a physics simulation), whereas <em>engines</em> are more efficient when the data  is stored in the components. (You could use a <em>system</em> to update data in components, but it would be inefficient, because you would have to perform a lot of lookups to access the component data.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are a couple of questions you should ask yourself in advance.</p>
<ul>
<li>On what data do we operate?</li>
<li>What is our domain?</li>
<li>What is the possible input for our transformation?</li>

<p>At the end of this, you should be able to answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What kind of data am I going to read?</li>
<li>What kind of data am I going to write?</li>
<li>Should my operation be exclusive? Hence not to be executed in parallel?</li>
<li>In which phase does it run? </li>
<li>What dependencies do I have?</li>
</ul>
<p>Those answers are important for the automatic scheduling of the Systems/Engines. Based on all those inputs, the Entity System can determine when and how to schedule what.</p>
<h2 id="best-practice-2"><a class="header" href="#best-practice-2">Best Practice</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>System/Engine Scope:</strong> Systems should be designed to have one job only. This can be difficult at times, especially when designing new features. Therefore it is fine to first create a bigger system and then with time make them smaller. If you find that your engine/system does a lot of things, don't worry. In an ECS things are decoupled from everything else, therefore it is generally pretty easy to split them up into smaller units. This allows you to increase reusability of systems</li>
<li><strong>System/Engine Scheduling:</strong> Always provide a write list and a list of components your Engine/System is operating on. This is important so the scheduler can do its best! Also do not forget to make use of <code>.before_me</code>, <code>.after_me</code> and <code>.phase</code> more about this in the next chapter!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="example-1"><a class="header" href="#example-1">Example</a></h2>
<pre><code class="language-c">const tm_engine_i movement_engine = {
    .ui_name = &quot;movement_engine&quot;,
    .hash = TM_STATIC_HASH(&quot;movement_engine&quot;, 0x336880a23d06646dULL),
    .num_components = 4,
    .components = {keyboard_component, movement_component, transform_component,
                   mover_component},
    .writes = {false, false, true, true},
    .update = movement_update,
    .inst = (tm_engine_o *)ctx,
};
tm_entity_api-&gt;register_engine(ctx, &amp;movement_engine);
</code></pre>
<p>This movement engine will operate on:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>keyboard_component</code></li>
<li><code>movement_component</code></li>
<li><code>transform_component</code></li>
<li><code>mover_component</code></li>
</ul>
<p>components. The scheduler can now look for those components in other engines and determine based on the .<code>write</code> field how to schedule it efficiently.</p>
<p>In this example the scheduler can schedule any engine that writes to the keyboard and the movement component that the same time as this engine if they do not write to the transform and mover component!</p>

<p><strong>What kind of data am I going to read?  &amp;&amp; What kind of data am I going to write?</strong></p>
<p>They translate <code>.write</code> and <code>.components.</code> With those fields, we tell the scheduler what components this system operates. From which components it intends to read from and to which one it writes.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of data do I want to ignore?</strong> (only important for engines)</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/plugins/entity/entity.h.html#structtm_engine_i"><code>tm_engine_i</code></a> you can provide a way to filter your component. Thus you can decide on which components the engine shall run.  The field <code>.excluded</code> is used for this in there you can define which components an entity type shall <strong>not</strong> have. This means that when the engine is scheduled all entities will be ignored with those components. </p>
<p>For more information see <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book//gameplay_coding/ecs/tagging_entities.html">Tagging Entities</a> and <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book//gameplay_coding/ecs/filtering_entities.html">Filtering Entities</a></p>
<p><strong>Should my operation be exclusive? Hence not to be executed in parallel?</strong></p>
<p>If we are sure that our system/engine should not run parallel, we need to tell the scheduler by setting the <code>.exclusive</code> flag to true. It will not run in parallel with any other systems or engines in the entity context. If it is <strong>false</strong> then the components and writes will be used to determine parallelism.</p>
<p><strong>In which phase does it run?</strong> </p>
<p>We can define the <code>.phase</code> to tell the system in which phase we want our operation to run.</p>
<p><strong>What dependencies do I have?</strong></p>
<p>We can define dependencies by saying: <code>.before_me</code> and <code>.after_me</code>. We just pass the string hash of the other engine/system to this, and the scheduler does the rest.</p>

<p>To register Systems/Engines, you need to provide a register function to the <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/plugins/entity/entity.h.html#tm_entity_register_engines_simulation_i"><code>tm_entity_register_engines_simulation_i</code></a> interface. This function has the signature:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">static void entity_register_engines_i(struct tm_entity_context_o *ctx)
</code></pre>
<p>For more information check the <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/plugins/entity/entity.h.html#tm_entity_register_engines_simulation_i"><code>tm_entity_register_engines_simulation_i</code></a> .</p>
<p>Whenever the Machinery creates an Entity Context, it calls this function and registers all your Systems / Engines to this context.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Entity context is the world in which all your entities exist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Engines, you pass an instance of the <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/plugins/entity/entity.h.html#structtm_entity_system_i"><code>tm_entity_system_i</code></a> to the register function.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">// example:

      ctx, TM_TT_TYPE_HASH__MOVEMENT_COMPONENT);
  tm_component_type_t transform_component =

<p>For Systems, you pass an instance of the <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/plugins/entity/entity.h.html#structtm_engine_i"><code>tm_engine_i</code></a> to the register function.</p>

<p>In the above example the scheduler will schedule this system after the <code>maze_generation_system</code> system!

<p>In this example, we want to create a new plugin, which contains our component. We open the Engine go to <strong>file -&gt; New Plugin -&gt; Entity Component.</strong> The file dialog will pop up and ask us where we want to save our file. Pick a location that suits you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Maybe store your plugin in a folder next to your game project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After this, we see that the Engine created some files for us. Now we need to ensure that we can build our project. In the root folder (The folder with the <code>premake</code> file), we run <code>tmbuild,</code> and if there is no issue, we see that it will build our projects once and generate the <code>.sln</code> file (on windows). If there is an issue, we should ensure we have set up the Environment variables correctly and installed all the needed dependencies. For more information, please read this <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book/helper_tools/tmbuild.html">guide</a>.</p>

We define one in our function and give it the needed information:</p>
<ul>
<li>A name should be the same as the Truth Type</li>
<li>The size of the component struct</li>
<li>A load asset function</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-c">static void component__create(struct tm_entity_context_o *ctx) {
  tm_component_i component = {
      .name = TM_TT_TYPE__CUSTOM_COMPONENT,
      .bytes = sizeof(struct tm_custom_component_t),
      .load_asset = component__load_asset,
  };

  tm_entity_api-&gt;register_component(ctx, &amp;component);
}
</code></pre>
<p>As mentioned before, the Truth does not reflect the runtime data and only holds the data you can edit in the Editor. This is why there needs to be some translation between The Truth and the ECS. This magic is happening in the <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/plugins/entity/entity.h.html#structtm_component_i.load_asset()"><code>tm_component_i.load_asset()</code></a>. This function allows you to translate a <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/api_types.h.html#structtm_tt_id_t"><code>tm_tt_id_t</code></a> asset to the plain old data of the component.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">static bool component__load_asset(tm_component_manager_o *man,
                                  struct tm_entity_commands_o *commands,
                                  tm_entity_t e, void *c_vp,
                                  const tm_the_truth_o *tt, tm_tt_id_t asset) {
  struct tm_custom_component_t *c = c_vp;
  const tm_the_truth_object_o *asset_r = tm_tt_read(tt, asset);
  c-&gt;y0 = 0;
  c-&gt;frequency = tm_the_truth_api-&gt;get_float(
      tt, asset_r, TM_TT_PROP__CUSTOM_COMPONENT__FREQUENCY);
  c-&gt;amplitude = tm_the_truth_api-&gt;get_float(
      tt, asset_r, TM_TT_PROP__CUSTOM_COMPONENT__AMPLITUDE);
  return true;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The first step is that we cast the given <code>void*</code> of the component data <code>c_vp</code> to the correct data type. After that, we load the data from the Truth and store it in the component. In the end, we return true because no error occurred.</p>

<h3 id="register-your-engine-to-the-system"><a class="header" href="#register-your-engine-to-the-system">Register your Engine to the system</a></h3>
<p>You can register a component to the <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/plugins/entity/entity.h.html#tm_entity_register_engines_simulation_i"><code>tm_entity_register_engines_simulation_i</code></a> in your plugin load function. This interface expects a function pointer to a create component function of the signature: <code>void tm_entity_register_engines_i(struct tm_entity_context_o *ctx)</code>. </p>
<p>The function itself looks as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">static void component__register_engine(struct tm_entity_context_o *ctx) {
  const tm_component_type_t custom_component =
      tm_entity_api-&gt;lookup_component_type(ctx,

      .inst = (tm_engine_o *)ctx,
  };
  tm_entity_api-&gt;register_engine(ctx, &amp;custom_component_engine);
}
</code></pre>
<p>The first thing we do is to look up the component type. Did we register the type? If not, we will not get the correct type. Here we are using the name we defined beforehand in our component create function.</p>
<p>Then we ask for the transform component next because our Engine shall run on those two components.</p>
<p>After this, we define the actual instance of our engine struct</p>
<p><a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/plugins/entity/entity.h.html#structtm_engine_i"><code>tm_engine_i</code></a>. </p>
<p>We provide a <code>.ui_name</code> used in the Profiler to identify our Engine. Moreover, we add a unique string hash identifying this engine/system. This is used for scheduling the engine/system concerning other engines and systems, using the<code>before_me</code> and <code>after_me</code> fields.</p>
<p>Then we tell the system how many components the Engine shall operate on and which ones we will modify. This is used for scheduling the engines later one.</p>
<p>At last, we provide the needed update function, which we have discussed earlier, and a filter function.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">static bool engine_filter__custom_component(
    tm_engine_o *inst, const tm_component_type_t *components,
    uint32_t num_components, const tm_component_mask_t *mask) {
  return tm_entity_mask_has_component(mask, components[0]) &amp;&amp;
         tm_entity_mask_has_component(mask, components[1]);
}
</code></pre>
<p>The filter function will be called on all entity types to determine if the Engine shall run on them or not.  To provide this function is optional. If present it specifies a filter function called for each entity type (as</p>
<p>represented by its component mask) to determine if the Engine should run on that entity type. If no <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/plugins/entity/entity.h.html#structtm_engine_i.filter()"><code>tm_engine_i.filter()</code></a> function is supplied and no <code>excludes[]</code> flags are set, the update will run on entity types that have all the components in the <code>components</code> array. If some <code>excludes[]</code> flags are set, the Engine will run on all entity types that <strong>do not</strong> have any of the components whose <code>excludes[]</code> flags are set, but have all the other components in the <code>components</code> array. </p>

</ul>
<h2 id="using-the-tag-component"><a class="header" href="#using-the-tag-component">Using the Tag Component</a></h2>
<p>The difference is that the first solution can be used via the <code>tag_component_api</code> and you can add Tags via the Editor to any Entity that has a Tag Component. Later on in your System or Engine you can access the Tagged Entity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is not the most performant solution but an easy way for entities which do not exist many times in the world. It is a nice way to identify one or two specific entities for some specific logic.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="adding-them-via-the-editor"><a class="header" href="#adding-them-via-the-editor">Adding them via The Editor</a></h3>
<p>You need to select an Entity and <strong>Right Click -&gt; Add Component</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/x6pntlc4u0vw9pa/tm_guide_entity_tag_add_component.png?dl=1" alt="" /></p>
<p>This will add the <em>Entity Tag</em> Component. When selected you have the chance to add Tags to the Entity by using a simple autocomplete textbox. </p>
<p><strong>Beware:</strong> The Engine will create an entity tag folder in your root folder. This is also the place where the Entity Tag API will search for the assets.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ve5lr0e0qcs221e/tm_guide_entity_tag.png?dl=1" alt="" /></p>
<h3 id="adding-and-accessing-tags-via-c"><a class="header" href="#adding-and-accessing-tags-via-c">Adding and Accessing Tags via C</a></h3>
<p>You can also add tags via the <code>tag_component_api</code> but you need access to the <code>Tag Component Manager</code>. In your System or on Simulate Entry <code>start()</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">tm_tag_component_manager_o *tag_mgr = (tm_tag_component_manager_o *)tm_entity_api-&gt;component_manager(ctx, tag_component);
tm_tag_component_api-&gt;add_tag(tag_mgr, my_to_tagged_entity, TM_STATIC_HASH(&quot;player&quot;, 0xafff68de8a0598dfULL));
</code></pre>
<p>You can also receive entities like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">tm_tag_component_manager_o *tag_mgr = (tm_tag_component_manager_o *)tm_entity_api-&gt;component_manager(ctx, tag_component);
tm_entity_t upper_bounding_box = tm_tag_component_api-&gt;find_first(tag_mgr, TM_STATIC_HASH(&quot;upper_bounding_box&quot;, 0x1afc9d34ecb740ecULL));
</code></pre>
<p>And than you can read the data from the entity via <code>get_component</code>. This is where you will perform a random look up and this might be slow. Therefore it is mostly recommended to use this for simple interactions where performance is not needed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Tags do not need to exist in the Asset Browser, therefore you can add any label to the entity. Keep in mind that they will <strong>not</strong> be created in the Asset Browser!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="tag-components---entity-type-filter"><a class="header" href="#tag-components---entity-type-filter">Tag Components - Entity Type Filter</a></h2>
<p>On the other hand you can define a <code>Tag</code> Component which should not be confused with the previously explained <code>Tag Component</code>. A tag component is a simple typedef of a <code>unit64_t</code> (or something else) or an empty struct in C++ to a component without properties. A tag is a component that does not have any data. The function of this component is to modify the Entity Type / Archetype to group entities together with them.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em></p>
<p>You have the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Component A</li>
<li>Component B</li>
</ul>
<p>And 2 systems :</p>
<ul>
<li>System A </li>
<li>System B</li>
</ul>
<p>They both shall operate on Component A &amp; B but have different logic based on what the Components represent. To archive this you just add a tag component to each Entity:</p>
<pre><code>#1 Entity:
- Component A
- Component B
- My Tag For System A
#2 Entity:
- Component A
- Component B
- My Tag for System A
</code></pre>
<p>In this example System B would not operate on both Entities if we use the <code>.excluded</code> filter to exclude <code>My Tag For System A</code> from the System.</p>

<p>In an Engine (<a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/plugins/entity/entity.h.html#structtm_engine_i"><code>tm_engine_i</code></a>) you can define the <code>.excluded</code> field. This tells the scheduler that this engine shall <strong>not</strong> run on any entity type that contains these components.</p>
<p>Let us assume we have the following entities:</p>
<pre><code>#1 Entity:
- Component A
- Component B
- Component C
#2 Entity:
- Component A
- Component B
- Component D
</code></pre>
<p>Now we have an Engine that shall operate on <code>(Component A,Component B)</code> but we do not want it to operate on entities with <code>Component D</code> we could just check in our update loop:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">static void entity_register_engines(struct tm_entity_context_o *ctx) {

  tm_component_type_t component_a =
      tm_entity_api-&gt;lookup_component_type(ctx, TM_TT_TYPE_HASH__A_COMPONENT);
  tm_component_type_t component_b =
      tm_entity_api-&gt;lookup_component_type(ctx, TM_TT_TYPE_HASH__B_COMPONENT);
  tm_component_type_t component_d =
      tm_entity_api-&gt;lookup_component_type(ctx, TM_TT_TYPE_HASH__D_COMPONENT);
  const tm_engine_i movement_engine = {
      .ui_name = &quot;movement_engine&quot;,
      .hash = TM_STATIC_HASH(&quot;movement_engine&quot;, 0x336880a23d06646dULL),
      .num_components = 2,
      .components = {component_a, component_b},
      .writes = {false, true},
      .excluded = {component_d},
      .num_excluded = 1,
      .update = movement_update,
      .inst = (tm_engine_o *)ctx,
  };
  tm_entity_api-&gt;register_engine(ctx, &amp;movement_engine);
}
</code></pre>
<p>or we could define a component mask and use this to filter but both methods are slow. This is because <code>get_component_by_hash</code> or <code>get_component</code> require us to look up internally the entity + the components and search for them. Its aka a random memory access! </p>
<p>To avoid all of this we can just tell the engine to ignore all entity types which contain the <code>component_d</code> via the <code>.excluded</code> field in the <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/plugins/entity/entity.h.html#structtm_engine_i"><code>tm_engine_i</code></a>.</p>

<h2 id="filtering-entities-by-using-tag-components"><a class="header" href="#filtering-entities-by-using-tag-components">Filtering Entities by using Tag Components</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You can define a <code>Tag</code> Component which should not be confused with the <code>Tag Component</code>. A tag component is a simple typedef of a <code>unit64_t</code> (or something else) or an empty struct in C++ to a component without properties. The function of this component is it to modify the Entity Type / Archetype to group entities together with them.For more information see the <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book//gameplay_coding/ecs/tagging_entities.html">Tagging Entities</a> Chapter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You have a Movement / Input System which should always work. At some point you do not want an entity to receive any input. </p>
<p><em>Solution 1</em></p>
<p>To solve this issue you could remove the Movement Component but that would be annoying because you would loose its state, which might be important.</p>
<p><em>Better Solution</em></p>
<p>First you define the component:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#define TM_TT_TYPE__PLAYER_NO_MOVE_TAG_COMPONENT &quot;tm_player_no_move_t&quot;
#define TM_TT_TYE_HASH__PLAYER_NO_MOVE_TAG_COMPONENT                           \
  TM_STATIC_HASH(&quot;tm_player_no_move_t&quot;, 0xc58cb6ade683ca88ULL)
static void component__create(struct tm_entity_context_o *ctx) {
  tm_component_i component = (tm_component_i){
      .name = TM_TT_TYPE__PLAYER_NO_MOVE_TAG_COMPONENT,
      .bytes = sizeof(uint64_t), // since we do not care of its content we can
                                 // just pick any 8 byte type
  };
  tm_entity_api-&gt;register_component(ctx, &amp;component);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then you filter in your update for the Input Engine/ Movement Engine any Entity that has a No Movement Tag:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">tm_component_type_t transform_component = tm_entity_api-&gt;lookup_component_type(
    ctx, TM_TT_TYPE_HASH__TRANSFORM_COMPONENT);
tm_component_type_t mover_component =
    tm_entity_api-&gt;lookup_component_type(ctx, TM_TT_TYPE_HASH__MOVER_COMPONENT);
tm_component_type_t movement_component = tm_entity_api-&gt;lookup_component_type(
    ctx, TM_TT_TYPE_HASH__MOVEMENT_COMPONENT);
tm_component_type_t no_movement_tag_component =
    tm_entity_api-&gt;lookup_component_type(
        ctx, TM_TT_TYE_HASH__PLAYER_NO_MOVE_TAG_COMPONENT);

const tm_engine_i movement_engine = {
    .ui_name = &quot;movement_engine&quot;,
    .hash = TM_STATIC_HASH(&quot;movement_engine&quot;, 0x336880a23d06646dULL),
    .num_components = 3,
    .components = {movement_component, transform_component, mover_component},
    .writes = {false, true, true},
    .excluded = {no_movement_tag_component},
    .num_excluded = 1,
    .update = movement_update,
    .inst = (tm_engine_o *)ctx,
};
tm_entity_api-&gt;register_engine(ctx, &amp;movement_engine);
</code></pre>
<p>Whenever another <code>engine/system</code> decides that an entity should not move anymore it just adds a <code>no_movement_tag_component</code> to the entity.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">static void my_other_system(tm_engine_o *inst, tm_engine_update_set_t *data,
                            struct tm_entity_commands_o *commands) {
  struct tm_entity_context_o *ctx = (struct tm_entity_context_o *)inst;
  tm_component_type_t no_movement_tag_component =
      tm_entity_api-&gt;lookup_component_type(
          ctx, TM_TT_TYE_HASH__PLAYER_NO_MOVE_TAG_COMPONENT);
  // code ..
  for (tm_engine_update_array_t *a = data-&gt;arrays;
       a &lt; data-&gt;arrays + data-&gt;num_arrays; ++a) {
    // code...
    for (uint32_t x = 0; x &lt; a-&gt;n; ++x) {
      // code...
      if (player_should_not_walk_anymore) {
        tm_entity_commands_api-&gt;add_component(commands, a-&gt;entities[x],
                                              no_movement_tag_component);
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see the Movement Engine will now update all other entities in the game which do not have the No Movement Tag.</p>

<p>In your Engine / Systems you an define in which Phase of the Update loop, your Engine / System shall run. This can be managed via the:  <code>.before_me</code>, <code>.after_me</code> and <code>.phase</code>  fields of your engine or system definition. </p>
<p>Please keep in mind that the Scheduler will order your system based on what kind of components you might modify or not! This is why it is always recommended to say what kind of components your system/engine will operate on and what they will do with them (Write to them or not). Depending on your dependencies the scheduler will decide if your engine/system can run in parallel.</p>

<p>In the Machinery you have multiple entry points for your game play code to live in. You can make use of <em>Simulation Entries</em>, <em>Entity Component System: Systems or Engines</em> and also make use of a <em>Entity Graph</em> or custom scripting language component. The question is more when to use which of the tools? The answer to this depends on your game's needs. To summarize it in the Engine you have about four built-in entry points for your game play code which you can use all at the same time and which one to use depends on your use case.</p>
<p>The following table will give a brief overview of the different types and their properties:</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> These recommendations are no guidelines! You do not <strong>have to follow them</strong> they are just here to give another more example driven overview of the different types of gameplay entry points.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="system-vs-engine"><a class="header" href="#system-vs-engine">System vs Engine</a></h3>
<p><strong>Systems</strong></p>
<p>It is recommended to use a <strong>System over an Engine</strong> when you try to write a complex gameplay system that will handle <strong>a few</strong> <strong>different entity types</strong> simultaneously. The number of entities here is important. Since a System uses random memory access through get_component() which may lead to cache misses.</p>
<p>Moreover, a System is a preferred way of updating when the data in the component is just a pointer into some external system. (This is the case, for example, for PhysX components). In the case of PhysX, it is assumed to store its data in a cache-friendly order, which means we do <em>not</em> want to iterate over the entities in the order they are stored in the entity system since this would cause a pointer chasing in the external System. Instead, we just want to send a single update to the external System. It will process the entities in its own (cache-friendly) order.</p>
<p>Another reason to use <strong>System over an Engine</strong> is that you can use it to execute things on initialization and on the game's shutdown since only <strong>Systems</strong> have a <code>init()</code> and a <code>shutdown()</code> function, Engines do not.</p>
<p><strong>Engines</strong></p>
<p>It is recommended to use an <strong>Engine over a System</strong> when you try to write a complex gameplay system that will handle <strong>a lot of entities with the same set of components</strong> simultaneously. The ECS scheduler will gather all entities with the set of components and enable you to iterate over them in a cache-friendly manner. This allows you to write an engine that can manipulate a lot of entities simultaneously without any loss of performance.</p>
<h3 id="simulation-entry-vs-system"><a class="header" href="#simulation-entry-vs-system">Simulation Entry vs System</a></h3>
<p>It is recommended to use a <strong>Simulation Entry</strong> when you want to tie the lifetime of the underlying System to an Entity lifetime. This is a very similar concept to the &quot;GameObject&quot; Script concept in Unity. Suppose the entity that hosts the Simulation Entry Component is destroyed. In that case, the Update function will not be ticked anymore, and the System is destroyed. This can be a useful concept for level-specific Gameplay moments. A Simulation Entry also has a <code>start()</code> and <code>stop()</code> function. They are executed when the Simulation Entry is added or removed.</p>
<p>It is <strong>not</strong> recommended to use a Simulation Entry to handle a large mass of entities. For the same reason as the System is not used for this kind of purpose. The Simulation Entry will <strong>not run parallel</strong> and have random memory access.</p>
<h3 id="entity-graph"><a class="header" href="#entity-graph">Entity Graph</a></h3>
<p>It is recommended to use a <strong>Entity Graph</strong> when you want to tie the lifetime to an Entity and if you want to execute unperformant code since the Entity Graph is a Visual Scripting language that is interpreted. It will be naturally slow. The Entity Graph is also good to handle UI/UX elements or for quick prototyping when performance is not important. Keep in mind that an Entity Graph is not executed in parallel and also only access memory via random access.</p>

<p>If you desire to add your own logger sink to the ecosystem there are a few steps you need to take:</p>
<ol>

<li>You need to define a <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/log.h.html#structtm_logger_i"><code>tm_logger_i</code></a> in your file</li>
<li>You need add a <code>log</code> function to this interface

<ul>
<li>How to run tests</li>
<li>How to constantly monitor your changes</li>
<li>How to write tests in your plugin</li>
</ul>
<p>This walkthrough expects basic knowledge on how to create a plugin and how a plugin is structured. If you are missing this knowledge, then you can find out more <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book/extending_the_machinery/the_plugin_system.html">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> At this point, the testing framework is in the beginning stage. We are extending its capabilities overtime to meet the needs of modern game development QA pipelines.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="about-unit-tests"><a class="header" href="#about-unit-tests"><strong>About unit-tests</strong></a></h2>
<p>You can find the executable alongside <code>tmbuild</code> or the machinery executable in the <code>bin/ folder.</code> If you want to make the unit-tests executable globally accessible, you need to add it to your path environment variable. As you may have noticed, ensuring the quality of your build, <code>tmbuild</code> will run all unit tests of all plugins at the end of its build process. When you add a unit test to your plugin, it is guaranteed that its unit tests run every time you build. This is, of course, only guaranteed if the plugin system can find the plugin and its test.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> unit-tests will assume that the plugins live in a folder relative to the executable in the standardized folder plugins. If you need to load a plugin that is not in this folder, you need to provide a valid path via <code>-p/--plugin</code> so that unit-tests can find and run your tests.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="how-to-run-tests"><a class="header" href="#how-to-run-tests"><strong>How to run tests</strong></a></h2>
<p>To run all unit tests, execute unit-test, and it will run all tests besides the slow execution path tests. To run all unit tests, including the <em>&quot;slow&quot;</em> ones, you run <code>unit-tests.exe -s/--slow-paths</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You may have noticed that if you run <code>tmbuild</code> regularly, you are lucky and win in the &quot;lottery&quot; from time to time. This means <code>tmbuild</code> will run all unit tests including the slow ones via <code>unit-tests</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="how-to-constantly-monitor-your-changes"><a class="header" href="#how-to-constantly-monitor-your-changes"><strong>How to constantly monitor your changes</strong></a></h2>
<p>Like the editor, <code>unit-tests</code> supports <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/post/dll-hot-reloading-in-theory-and-practice/">hot reloading</a>. In a nutshell, whenever plugins are rebuilt <code>unit-tests</code> can detect this and rerun the tests. To run in hot-reload mode start<code>unit-tests</code> with the <code>-r/--hot-reload</code> argument.</p>
<p><em>When could this be useful?</em>
It can be helpful on CI Server where build and test servers are different. The build server's final build step uploads the generated <code>dlls</code> to the test server if everything works fine. The test server is monitoring the filesystem, and whenever the dlls change, <code>unit-tests</code> would rerun all tests, also the slow ones, to ensure that all works. It could save time on the build server so the build times are faster and the developer knows quicker if the build fails. Also, the build server does not need a graphics card to run eventual graphic pipeline-related tests. The test server, on the other hand, could run such tests.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-write-your-tests"><a class="header" href="#how-to-write-your-tests"><strong>How to write your tests</strong></a></h2>
<p>All that is needed is to write tests is to register them via the <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/unit_test.h.html#tm_unit_test_interface_name">tm_unit_test_i</a>. You can find the interface in the <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/unit_test.h.html">unit_tests.h</a>. <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/unit_test.h.html#tm_unit_test_i">tm_unit_test_i</a> expects a pointer of the type <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/unit_test.h.html#structtm_unit_test_i">tm_unit_test_i</a>.

<p>At this point, we have not tackled the following possible questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where and how do we register the interface?</li>
<li>What could this interface look like?</li>
<li>What does the test itself look like?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Let us walk through those questions:</strong></p>
<p><em>Where and how do we register the interface?</em>
We need to register our tests in the same function as everything else that needs to be executed when a plugin loads: in our <code>tm_load_plugin</code>. It may look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;foundation/unit_test.h&gt;
//...
// my amazing plugin
TM_DLL_EXPORT void tm_load_plugin(struct tm_api_registry_api *reg, bool load)
{
    tm_global_api_registry = reg;
    //...
    tm_add_or_remove_implementation(reg, load, tm_unit_test_i, my_unit_tests);
}

<p>Here we register our test interface to the <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/unit_test.h.html#structtm_unit_test_i"><code>tm_unit_test_i</code></a>.</p>
<p><em>What could this interface look like?</em>
After we have done this, all we need to do is declare our <code>my_unit_tests</code>. It is as easy as it gets:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;foundation/unit_test.h&gt;
//...
tm_unit_test_i *entity_unit_test = &amp;(tm_unit_test_i){
    .name = &quot;my_unit_tests&quot;,
    .test = test_function,
};
</code></pre>
<p><em>What does the test itself look like?</em>
All that's left is to write the test. Let us write this test. In its core all we need to do is write a function of the signature: <code>(tm_unit_test_runner_i *tr, struct tm_allocator_i *a)</code>. In its body, we can define our tests.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">static void test_function(tm_unit_test_runner_i *test_runner, tm_allocator_i *allocator)
{
    //.. code
}
</code></pre>
<p>The test runner variable test_runner is needed to communicate back to the test suite about failures etc. The following <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/unit_test.h.html#tm_unit_test()">macros</a> will help you write tests. They are the heart of the actual tests.</p>

<ul>

</ul>
<h2 id="about-integration-tests"><a class="header" href="#about-integration-tests"><strong>About integration tests</strong></a></h2>
<p>Integration testing is the phase in testing software in which individual software modules are combined and tested as a group. Integration testing is conducted to evaluate a system's compliance or its interaction as a whole within specified functional requirements. 
It is generally used after unit testing to ensure that the composition of the software works. It is a potent tool to validate certain bugs that are hard to reproduce only after using software extensively. You can simulate this with integration tests. Besides, it is a very powerful tool validating that a bug fix was successful.</p>
<p>By their very nature, integration tests are slower and more fragile than unit tests, but they can also find issues that are hard to detect with regular unit tests. Each integration test runs in a specific &quot;context&quot;, identified by a string hash. The context specifies the &quot;scaffolding&quot; is set up before the unit test runs.</p>

<p><strong>Where to find the integration test framework?</strong></p>
<p>The integration test framework can be found in the <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/integration_test.h.html">integration_test.h</a> ,and is part of the foundation library. We need to include this header file, and then we can start writing our tests.</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;foundation/integration_test.h&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>To write a test you need to register it via the <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/integration_test.h.html#tm_integration_test_i">tm_integration_test_i</a>. It expects a pointer of the type <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/integration_test.h.html#structtm_integration_test_i">tm_integration_test_i</a>. This interface expects a name and a function pointer to the test function (tick). Also, it expects a context. The context is a string hash. For example: <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/integration_test.h.html#tm_integration_test_context__the_machinery_editor"><code>TM_INTEGRATION_TEST_CONTEXT__THE_MACHINERY_EDITOR</code></a>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">// Interface for integration tests.

<p>The name field is important because, later on, we need to use this name when we want to run the test.

<p>To run your newly created integration test, we need to build the project via tmbuild. Then start The Machinery with the <code>-t/--test [NAME]</code> parameter. It runs the specified integration test. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can use multiple --test arguments to run multiple tests. This will boot up the engine and run your integration tests.</p>

<p>We described <code>tmbuild</code>'s core idea in our blog-post <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/post/one-button-source-code-builds/"><em>One-button source code builds</em></a>. <code>tmbuild</code> is our custom one-click &quot;build system.&quot; and it is quite a powerful tool. It allows you to do the most important tasks when developing with The Machinery: Building your plugin or the whole engine.</p>
<p>You can execute the tool from any terminal such as PowerShell or the VS Code internal Console window.</p>
<p>The key features are:</p>
<ul>
<li>building</li>
<li>packaging</li>
<li>cleaning the solution/folder</li>
<li>downloading all the dependencies</li>
<li>running our unit tests</li>
</ul>
<p>This walkthrough introduces you to <code>tmbuild</code> and shows you how to use and manipulate The Machinery Projects. You will learn about:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to build with it</li>
<li>How to build a specific project with it</li>
<li>How to package your project</li>

<h2 id="installing-tmbuild"><a class="header" href="#installing-tmbuild"><strong>Installing tmbuild</strong></a></h2>
<p>When you download and unzip <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/">The Machinery</a> either via the <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/beta.html">website</a> or via the <a href="helper_tools/tmbuild.html#">download tab</a> you can find tmbuild in the bin folder in the root. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alternatively, you can build it from source <code>code\utils.</code> We will talk about this later in this walkthrough. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before we use tmbuild, we need to ensure that we have installed either <em>build-essentials</em> under Linux, <em>XCode</em> on Mac, or <em>Visual Studio 2017 or 2019</em> (Either the Editor such as the Community Edition or the Build Tools). </p>
<p><strong>Windows Side nodes:</strong></p>
<p>On Windows, it is essential to install the C/C++ Build tools. 
If you run into the issue that tmbuild cannot find Visual Studios 2019 on Windows, it could be because you installed it on a typical path.  No problem, you can just set the environment variable <code>TM_VS2017_DIR</code> or <code>TM_VS2019_DIR</code> to the root <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019</code>. The tool will find the right installed version automagically.</p>
<h2 id="set-up-our-environment-variables"><a class="header" href="#set-up-our-environment-variables"><strong>Set up our environment variables</strong></a></h2>
<p>Before we can build any project, we need to set up our environment. You need to set the following environment variable: 
(If this one has not been set the tool will not be able to build)</p>
<ul>
<li><code>TM_SDK_DIR</code> - This is the path to find the folder <code>headers</code> and the folder <code>lib</code></li>
</ul>
<p>If the following variable is not set, the tool will assume that you intend to use the current working directory:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>TM_LIB_DIR</code> - The folder which determines where to download and install all dependencies (besides the build environments)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to add environment variables?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Windows</strong></p>
<p>On Windows all you need to do is you need to add the folder where you installed The Machinery to your environment variables. You can do this like this:
<strong>Start &gt; Edit the system environment variables &gt; environment variables &gt; system variables &gt; click New... &gt;</strong> add <code>TM_SDK_DIR</code> or <code>TM_LIB_DIR</code> as the Variable Name and the needed path as the Variable Value.
Close and restart the terminal or Visual Studio / Visual Studio Code.
As an alternative, you can set an environment variable via PowerShell before you execute tmbuild, which will stay alive till the end of the session:
<code>$Env:TM_SDK_DIR=&quot;..PATH&quot;</code></p>
<p><strong>Debian/Ubuntu Linux</strong></p>
<p>You open the terminal or edit with your favorite text editor <code>~/.bashrc</code> and you add the following lines:</p>
<pre><code>#...
export TM_SDK_DIR=path/to/themachinery/
export TM_LIB_DIR=path/to/themachinery/libs
</code></pre>
<p>(e.g. via nano nano <code>~/.bashrc</code>)</p>
<h2 id="let-us-build-a-plugin"><a class="header" href="#let-us-build-a-plugin"><strong>Let us Build a plugin</strong>.</a></h2>
<p>All you need to do is: navigate to the <strong>root folder</strong> of your plugin and run in PowerShell <code>tmbuild.exe</code>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have not added tmbuild.exe to your global PATH, you need to have the right path to where tmbuild is located. <code>user@machine/home/user/tm/plugins/my_plugin/&gt; ./../../bin/tmbuild</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This command does all the magic. tmbuild will automatically download all the needed dependencies etc., for you <em>(Either in the location set in <code>TM_LIB_DIR</code> or in the current working directory)</em>. 
You may have noticed tmbuild will always run unit tests at the end of your build process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> tmbuild will only build something when there is a premake5.lua and a libs.json in the current <em>working directory</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="let-us-build-a-specific-project"><a class="header" href="#let-us-build-a-specific-project"><strong>Let us build a specific project</strong>.</a></h2>
<p>Imagine you have been busy and written a bunch of plugins, and they are all connected and managed via the same Lua file (premake5 file). 
Now you do not want to check everything all the time. No problem, you can follow these steps:
If you run <code>tmbuild --help/-h</code>, you will see many options. One of those options is <code>--project</code>. This one allows you to build a specific project.</p>
<pre><code>tmbuild.exe --project my-project-name
</code></pre>
<p>The tool will automatically find the right project and build it. 
On Windows, you can also provide the relative/absolute path to the project with extension: ``</p>
<pre><code>tmbuild --project /path/to/project.vcxproj
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>
If a project cannot be found it will build all projects.</p>

<h2 id="how-how-to-package-a-project-via-tmbuild"><a class="header" href="#how-how-to-package-a-project-via-tmbuild">How how to package a project via tmbuild?</a></h2>
<p>To package a project via tmbuild, all you need to do is use the <code>-p [package name]</code> or <code>--package [package name]</code> command. A package file needs to be of type <code>.json</code> and follow our package scheme, which you can find <a href="helper_tools/tmbuild.html#">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-build-or-manipulate-tmbuild-from-source"><a class="header" href="#how-to-build-or-manipulate-tmbuild-from-source">How to build or manipulate tmbuild from source</a></h2>
<p>You can find the source code of tmbuild in the folder <code>code\utils\tmbuild</code>. In the folder <code>code\utils</code>, you can also find the source code of all the other uses the engine uses.</p>
<p>You can build tmbuild via tmbuild. All you need to do is navigate the <code>code\utils</code> folder and run <code>tmbuild --project tmbuild</code>. </p>
<p>If you do not have access to a build version of tmbuild but to the whole source, you have to follow the following steps:</p>
<p><strong>Windows 10</strong></p>
<p>Make sure you have Visual Studio 19 and the Build Tools installed. Besides, check if you can find <code>msbuild</code> in the terminal. You can install <code>msbuild / vs studio</code> via PowerShell: <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vssetup.powershell">https://github.com/Microsoft/vssetup.powershell</a></p>
<p>To check just run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">msbuild
</code></pre>
<p>if you cannot find it just add it to your environment path variables: with e.g.
<code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\MSBuild\Current\Bin\</code></p>
<p><strong>To build from source:</strong></p>
<p>Open a PowerShell instance in The Machinery folder and run the following commands:</p>
<pre><code class="language-powershell"># this part can be skipped if you have already downloaded

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="how-to-use-hashexe"><a class="header" href="#how-to-use-hashexe">How to use hash.exe</a></h1>
<p>This walkthrough introduces you to hash.exe and shows you how to use it with The Machinery. </p>
<p>You will learn about:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to use <code>hash.exe</code> and  <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/api_types.h.html#tm_static_hash()"><code>TM_STATIC_HASH</code></a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-use-hashexe-and-tm_static_hash"><a class="header" href="#how-to-use-hashexe-and-tm_static_hash">How to use hash.exe and TM_STATIC_HASH</a></h2>
<p>While working with The Machinery, you will have surely noticed that its systems often expect a hashed version of a string as input. In this document, we will be dealing with static hashes defined with <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/api_types.h.html#tm_static_hash()">TM_STATIC_HASH</a> to identify, for example, a type in our data model, <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book/the_truth/index.html">The Truth</a>. If you are searching documentation on runtime hashes, you’ll want to check out the <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/murmurhash64a.inl.html#murmurhash64a.inl">murmurhash64a.inl</a> files.</p>
<p>In this document, we will be using hash.exe to generate new hash values or update the changed ones. The hash.exe utility checks the entire source code and makes sure that wherever you use <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/api_types.h.html#tm_static_hash()"><code>TM_STATIC_HASH</code></a>, the numeric value v matches the actual hash of the string s (if not, the code is updated). If you do not run the executable before you build, you will have compile errors. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <code>tmbuild</code> has the option to run hash.exe before it builds. <code>tmbuild --gen-hash</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us look at where this tool is useful and is being used a lot:  In <a href="https://ourmachinery.github.io/themachinery-books/the_machinery_book/the_truth/index.html">The Truth</a>.</p>
<p>For example, When defining Truth Objects or Types, we are using this tool to hash the name of the type statically</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">//...

#define TM_TT_TYPE__ASSET &quot;tm_asset&quot;

#define TM_TT_TYPE_HASH__ASSET TM_STATIC_HASH(&quot;tm_asset&quot;, 0xca71127abbb72960ULL)

enum {

 TM_TT_PROP__ASSET__NAME = 0, // string

 TM_TT_PROP__ASSET__DIRECTORY, // reference(ASSET_DIRECTORY)

 TM_TT_PROP__ASSET__UUID_TAGS, // subobject_set(UINT64_T) storing the UUID of the associated tag.

 TM_TT_PROP__ASSET__OBJECT, // subobject(*)

};

//...
</code></pre>
<p>In the above example we have the definition of the Truth Type tm_asset. The <code>#define TM_TT_TYPE_HASH__ASSET TM_STATIC_HASH(&quot;tm_asset&quot;, 0xca71127abbb72960ULL)</code> was generated by the hash utility. Before the tool ran the code looked similar to this: <code>#define TM_TT_TYPE_HASH__ASSET TM_STATIC_HASH(&quot;tm_asset&quot;)</code></p>
<p>For example later on we can use it  to create an object of this type. If we do not have the corresponding type id <a href="https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/foundation/api_types.h.html#structtm_tt_type_t"><code>tm_tt_type_t</code></a> we need to ask The Truth: </p>
<pre><code class="language-c">tm_the_truth_api-&gt;object_type_from_name_hash(tt, TM_TT_TYPE_HASH__ASSET);
</code></pre>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="tmbuild-package-json-reference"><a class="header" href="#tmbuild-package-json-reference">tmbuild package json Reference</a></h1>
<p>The <code>tmbuild</code> can package a project based on rules set in a <code>.json</code> file. This file needs to adhere to the scheme described here.
Every package <code>json</code> file is structured in its core like this:</p>
<pre><code>{
    &quot;name&quot;:&quot;package name&quot;,
    &quot;steps&quot;: []
}
</code></pre>
<p>The name will be used to determine the name of the package folder in <code>tm root/build</code> directory. The steps are the key in the system. They will be executed linearly after each other and the next step will only be executed if the previous step was successful.
Steps are defined as a normal <code>json</code> object. The following list displays all the functions which can be used plus adequate examples.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="writing-an-executable"><a class="header" href="#writing-an-executable">Writing an executable</a></h2>
<p>Writing a stand-alone executable is similar to writing a plugin except that you need to write
initialization code for booting up all the systems that you want to use as well as the main loop
code that runs the executable.</p>
<p><code>bin/simple-draw.exe</code> is a sample executable that uses the UI / Draw2D interfaces of The Machinery
to implement a simple drawing program:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/bilirde9yud4rn3/simple-draw.png?dl=1" alt="Simple Draw executable." /></p>
<p>The source code of this sample program is available in the <code>samples</code> directory. By playing with
and modifying this, you can see how to build your own applications on top of <em>The Machinery</em>.</p>
<p>Note that just as when writing plugins, you need a Visual Studio installation (2019) to build an
executable. You need to set <code>TM_SDK_DIR</code> to the location of The Machinery SDK you are using, and you
use <code>tmbuild.exe</code> to build the executable.</p>
<p><code>bin/simple-3d.exe</code> is a sample executable that uses the full 3D API.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/oz9zob150yksnhr/simple-3d.png?dl=1" alt="Simple 3D executable." /></p>
<p>You will find the source code for this too in the samples directory.</p>
